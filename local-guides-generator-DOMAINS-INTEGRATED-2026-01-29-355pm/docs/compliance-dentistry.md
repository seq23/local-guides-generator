# Dentistry compliance addendum (Advertising + editorial separation)

This repo is an educational publisher, not a medical provider or referral service. We do not rate, rank, endorse, or recommend providers. Paid placements must be labeled “Advertising” and visually separated from editorial content.

## High-risk items to avoid (or handle carefully)
- Unverifiable clinical claims (“painless implants”, “guaranteed results”, “fastest healing”, “best outcomes”)
- Misleading before/after representations (must be truthful, typicality disclosures if used)
- Hidden sponsorships or undisclosed paid placements (must be labeled)
- Testimonials/endorsements without required disclosures
- “Best/top/#1” statements as recommendations (allowed only as *questions* + neutral methodology)

## Endorsements/testimonials disclosure (general)
Follow FTC endorsement guidance: disclose material connections clearly and conspicuously when an endorser is paid or otherwise incentivized.

## Professional/ethics considerations
Dental boards and professional bodies generally require advertising to be truthful and not misleading; claims must be supportable.

## What we do
- Neutral decision frameworks and checklists
- Official license verification links per state
- Clear “Advertising” labels
