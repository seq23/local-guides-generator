## Important Note

This page is for general information only. It does not provide legal advice. USCIS rules can change. Only USCIS decides what happens next in your case.

## Receiving Your Documents

Some people receive a sealed envelope. Others do not receive copies. Procedures vary by clinic.

## USCIS Review

USCIS reviews Form I-693 as part of the full application. The medical exam is only one part of the review process.

USCIS may request additional information if needed.

## Waiting Periods

Processing times vary. The medical exam does not control how fast USCIS reviews an application.

## Common Misunderstandings

- "The exam decides my case." USCIS decides all outcomes.

- "Results are immediate." Reviews take time.

## Spanish Summary (Optional)

- Después del examen, el médico completa el formulario.

- USCIS revisa la información.

## Bottom Line

After the USCIS medical exam, USCIS reviews the information as part of the overall application. The exam alone does not decide the outcome.

Fees vary by location and provider. Some clinics include services in one fee, while others itemize costs.

## Appointment Scheduling

How quickly you can schedule an exam depends on:

- Clinic availability

- Location

- Individual case factors

Some people are seen quickly, while others wait longer.

## USCIS Processing Time

The medical exam does not control USCIS processing speed. USCIS reviews many factors as part of an application.

## Common Misunderstandings

- "The exam has a fixed price." Costs vary.

- "The exam speeds up my case." USCIS controls timelines.

## Spanish Summary (Optional)

- Los costos del examen pueden variar.

# Form I-693 Medical Exam Requirements: What USCIS Usually Looks For

## Important Note

This page is for general information only. USCIS rules can change. Only USCIS and a civil surgeon decide what applies to your case.

## What Is Form I-693?

Form I-693 is the official USCIS form used to record the results of the immigration medical exam. The form is completed by a USCIS-approved doctor called a civil surgeon.

The form helps USCIS review certain health-related information required for immigration processing.

## Who Completes the Form

- The applicant provides basic personal information

- The civil surgeon completes the medical sections

- The applicant signs where required

Applicants should not fill out medical sections themselves.

## What the Form Usually Covers

Form I-693 may include information about:

- Medical history questions

- Required vaccinations

- Physical examination results

- Tests required by USCIS guidelines

Not every section applies to every person. The civil surgeon decides what is needed based on USCIS instructions.

## Vaccination Records

Applicants are often asked to provide vaccination records. If records are missing, the civil surgeon explains what options are available.

Vaccination requirements are set by USCIS and public health authorities. They can change over time.

## Signing and Sealing the Form

After the exam is complete, the civil surgeon signs Form I-693. The form is usually placed in a sealed envelope.

Applicants should not open sealed envelopes unless USCIS gives written instructions to do so.

## How USCIS Uses the Form

USCIS reviews Form I-693 as part of a larger application. The form alone does not approve or deny an immigration case.

USCIS may request a new form if information is missing or outdated.

## Common Misunderstandings

- "I can complete the form myself." Medical sections must be completed by a civil surgeon.

- "The form guarantees approval." USCIS makes all final decisions.

- "The form lasts forever." USCIS sets validity rules.

## Limits and Variations

Civil surgeons follow USCIS instructions, but office procedures may vary. Timing, required tests, and documentation can differ by case.

## Spanish Summary (Optional)

- El Formulario I-693 es el formulario médico oficial de USCIS.

- Solo un médico autorizado por USCIS puede completarlo.

- El formulario incluye información médica y de vacunación.

- USCIS decide cómo se usa el formulario.

## Bottom Line

Form I-693 records medical exam information for USCIS. It is required for many cases, but it does not decide the outcome by itself.

# USCIS Medical Exam Overview: What It Is and Why It’s Required

## Important Note

This page is for general information only. USCIS rules can change. Only USCIS and a civil surgeon decide what applies to your case.

## What Is the USCIS Medical Exam?

The USCIS medical exam is a health check required for many immigration applications. It helps USCIS confirm that an applicant meets basic health-related rules set by the U.S. government.

The exam is done by a doctor called a civil surgeon. Only doctors approved by USCIS can perform this exam.

The exam looks at items such as:

- General health history

## Who Usually Needs the Exam

Many people applying for permanent residence (a green card) need a USCIS medical exam. Some people may have completed an exam earlier in their process. USCIS decides when a new exam is required.
