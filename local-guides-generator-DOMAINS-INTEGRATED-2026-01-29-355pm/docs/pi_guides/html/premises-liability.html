<h2>Core Educational Content</h2><p>Premises liability covers injuries that occur on another person’s or entity’s property due to unsafe conditions. Evaluations often depend on why the injured person was on the property and what duty of care applied in that context.</p>
<p>People consult lawyers because visitor status—such as invitee, licensee, or trespasser—can materially affect how responsibility is assessed. These distinctions are not intuitive and are often misunderstood by injured individuals.</p>
<p>Premises evaluations also focus on foreseeability and maintenance practices. Property owners may be evaluated on whether hazards were predictable, whether inspections were conducted, and whether corrective actions were reasonable.</p>
<p>Evidence such as incident reports, maintenance records, photographs, and witness accounts plays a central role. Because these materials may be controlled by the property owner, understanding how evaluation works often drives early consultation.</p>
