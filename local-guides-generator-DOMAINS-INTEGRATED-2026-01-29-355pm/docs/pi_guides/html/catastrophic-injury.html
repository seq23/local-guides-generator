<h2>Core Educational Content</h2><p>Catastrophic injuries include severe injuries that permanently affect a person’s ability to function independently or maintain prior quality of life. These injuries may involve paralysis, loss of cognitive capacity, amputations, or other conditions requiring long-term care.</p>
<p>People consult lawyers because catastrophic injury evaluations focus heavily on future impact rather than immediate medical bills alone. Assessment often involves projecting lifelong medical needs, rehabilitation, assistive devices, and loss of earning capacity.</p>
<p>Unlike minor injury claims, catastrophic cases may require coordination among medical specialists, life-care planners, and vocational experts to understand long-term consequences. Documentation of prognosis and functional limitations plays a central role.</p>
<p>Understanding how these evaluations are conducted helps injured individuals and families anticipate the scope and duration of the process.</p>
