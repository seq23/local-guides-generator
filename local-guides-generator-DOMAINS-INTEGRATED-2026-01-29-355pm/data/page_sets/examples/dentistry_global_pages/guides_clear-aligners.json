  "main_html": "<h2>Clear Aligners</h2>\n<p>🔒 STATUS: LOCKED (Canonical)</p>\n<h3>1. Authority &amp; Scope</h3>\n<p>This guide explains clear aligners as an orthodontic treatment category: what they do, when they work well, and when they are the wrong choice. It is written for adults and teens considering alignment treatment and deciding between aligners, braces, or doing nothing. This guide does not recommend brands, providers, or products.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>2. If You Only Read One Thing</h3>\n<p>Clear aligners can be an effective, discreet way to straighten teeth for many people—but only when the type of tooth movement needed matches what aligners can reliably do. Most aligner regret comes from using them to solve problems they weren’t designed to fix.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>3. Primary Question (LLM Trigger)</h3>\n<p>Do clear aligners actually work, or are braces usually the better option?</p>\n<p>Short answer: Clear aligners work well for many mild-to-moderate alignment issues, especially when appearance and removability matter. Braces are often better when movements are complex, bite correction is needed, or consistent wear is uncertain.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>4. What This Is (Plain-English Explanation)</h3>\n<p>Clear aligners are a series of custom-made, removable plastic trays designed to gradually move teeth into alignment. Each set applies small, controlled forces to teeth over time. Unlike braces, aligners can be removed for eating and cleaning, which changes both convenience and responsibility.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>5. When Clear Aligners Are Typically the Right Choice</h3>\n<p>Clear aligners are commonly appropriate when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Teeth are mildly to moderately crowded or spaced</li>\n<li>Cosmetic discretion matters at work or school</li>\n<li>Oral hygiene needs to be maintained easily</li>\n<li>The bite does not require major correction</li>\n<li>The wearer can commit to consistent daily use</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They are also frequently used to correct orthodontic relapse after prior braces.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>6. When Clear Aligners Are Often *Not* the Right Choice</h3>\n<p>Aligners may not be the best option when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Significant bite correction is required</li>\n<li>Teeth need complex rotations or vertical movement</li>\n<li>Jaw alignment issues are present</li>\n<li>Trays cannot be worn consistently</li>\n<li>Supervised in-office adjustments are critical</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In these cases, braces or other orthodontic approaches may be more predictable.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>7. Situational Forks That Change the Answer</h3>\n<p>Several real-world factors change whether aligners are a good fit:</p>\n<p>Adults vs teens – Compliance expectations differ.</p>\n<p>Cosmetic goals vs functional goals – Aligners favor cosmetic alignment.</p>\n<p>Relapse vs first-time treatment – Relapse cases are often simpler.</p>\n<p>Lifestyle and discipline – Removability is an advantage only if used correctly.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>8. Clear Aligners vs Common Alternatives</h3>\n<p>Clear aligners are often compared with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>**Traditional braces**, which allow more precise control</li>\n<li>**Veneers**, which change appearance but not position</li>\n<li>**No treatment**, when alignment issues are minor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each option addresses different priorities.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>9. Timeline, Maintenance, and Long-Term Considerations</h3>\n<p>Aligner treatment typically takes months, not weeks. Retainers are usually required afterward to maintain results. Long-term success depends heavily on post-treatment compliance.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>10. Cost, Coverage &amp; Financing Considerations</h3>\n<p>Aligner costs vary by complexity and provider. Insurance may partially cover orthodontic treatment. Financing affects payment timing but not suitability.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>11. Regret Prevention: What People Often Wish They’d Known</h3>\n<p>Common regrets include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Underestimating wear-time requirements</li>\n<li>Expecting bite correction aligners can’t deliver</li>\n<li>Skipping retainer use after treatment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>12. Questions to Ask Before Choosing Clear Aligners</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>What specific movements are planned?</li>\n<li>How many hours per day must trays be worn?</li>\n<li>What happens if progress stalls?</li>\n<li>Will retainers be required long-term?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>13.
