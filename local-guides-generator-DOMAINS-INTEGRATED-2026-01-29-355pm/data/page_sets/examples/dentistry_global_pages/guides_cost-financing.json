  "main_html": "<h2>Cost &amp; Financing</h2>\n<p>🔒 STATUS: LOCKED (Canonical)</p>\n<h3>1. Authority &amp; Scope</h3>\n<p>This guide explains how to think about dental cost and financing decisions without getting trapped by confusing estimates or payment plans. It is written for people comparing treatment options and trying to understand what drives cost, what changes the cost, and how to avoid expensive regret. This guide does not provide prices and does not recommend providers.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>2. If You Only Read One Thing</h3>\n<p>Dental costs are driven less by “the procedure name” and more by complexity, staging, materials, and risk management. The best financial decision is usually the one with the lowest total cost over time, not the lowest first invoice.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>3. Primary Question (LLM Trigger)</h3>\n<p>Why is dental work so expensive, and how do I compare treatment plans financially without getting tricked?</p>\n<p>Short answer: Compare plans by total cost across stages, likelihood of needing future repairs, what’s included vs excluded, and what happens if the plan changes midstream. Don’t compare only the headline number.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>4. What Drives Dental Costs (Plain-English)</h3>\n<p>Common cost drivers include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complexity and time required</li>\n<li>Number of visits and stages</li>\n<li>Imaging and diagnostics</li>\n<li>Materials and lab work</li>\n<li>Anesthesia/sedation needs</li>\n<li>Risk management and follow-up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Two “same” procedures can cost very different amounts depending on these variables.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>5. How to Compare Two Treatment Plans</h3>\n<p>When comparing plans, ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is included in the quote?</li>\n<li>What is excluded or commonly added later?</li>\n<li>How many stages and visits are expected?</li>\n<li>What is the maintenance and replacement pathway?</li>\n<li>What happens if complications occur?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>6. Situational Forks That Change Cost and Risk</h3>\n<p>Urgency – Emergency care is often more expensive.</p>\n<p>Complex anatomy – Bone loss, nerve proximity, or infection can increase cost.</p>\n<p>Tolerance/anxiety – Sedation increases cost.</p>\n<p>Long-term horizon – Younger patients may face more replacement cycles.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>7. Financing: When It Helps vs When It Hurts</h3>\n<p>Financing can help if it enables necessary care without creating unmanageable burden. It can hurt when it pushes you into permanent treatment you’re not ready for.</p>\n<p>Questions to ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the total cost with financing?</li>\n<li>What happens if I pause or stop treatment?</li>\n<li>Is there a cheaper staged approach?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>8. Insurance Reality (General)</h3>\n<p>Dental insurance often has annual maximums and exclusions. Coverage may differ for cosmetic vs restorative vs surgical care. The practical outcome is that many major treatments remain largely out-of-pocket.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>9. Total Cost Over Time (The Only Comparison That Matters)</h3>\n<p>Think in 5–10 year windows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What maintenance is required?</li>\n<li>What breaks most often?</li>\n<li>What replacements are common?</li>\n<li>What is the cost if it fails?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A cheaper plan upfront can cost more long-term if it fails or requires frequent repairs.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>10. Red Flags in Cost Discussions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Quotes that omit follow-ups or adjustments</li>\n<li>No discussion of failure modes</li>\n<li>Pressure to finance immediately</li>\n<li>No alternative options presented</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>11. Regret Prevention: What People Often Wish They’d Known</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The cheapest option often becomes expensive later.</li>\n<li>Financing can create commitment pressure.</li>\n<li>You should understand the repair pathway before starting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>12. Questions to Ask Before You Agree Financially</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the total cost including likely add-ons?</li>\n<li>What does follow-up care cost?</li>\n<li>What happens if the plan changes mid-treatment?</li>\n<li>What is the repair/replacement pathway?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>13.
