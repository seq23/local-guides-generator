Not legal advice. No endorsements or rankings.</p></section>\n<section class=\"section\">\n  <h2 id=\"costs\">Costs</h2>\n  <p>Costs and fees vary a lot by city, state, case complexity, and how a firm structures fees. Most personal injury cases are handled on a contingency fee, but details differ. Use this section to compare fee structures, expense policies, and what happens if a case does not resolve the way you hope.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"section\">\n  <h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2>\n  <p>Timelines depend on the type of incident, medical treatment, insurance response, and local court schedules. Some matters resolve in weeks; others can take months or longer. Use this section to understand typical steps and where delays commonly happen.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"section\">\n  <h2 id=\"questions\">Questions to ask</h2>\n  <p>Before you contact any provider, prepare a short list of questions about experience, communication, fees, and what they need from you. A good initial call should feel clear and non-pushy.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"section\">\n  <h2 id=\"red-flags\">Red flags</h2>\n  <p>Be cautious of pressure tactics, guarantees of outcomes, unclear fee explanations, or anyone who will not put key terms in writing. If something feels off, pause and compare options.</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"callout\"><p><strong>If you only read one thing:</strong> These guides explain evaluation logic and documentation patterns — not whether you should hire anyone.</p></section>%%AD:global_guides_top%%<section class=\"section\"><h2>How to Use These Guides</h2><p>Each guide walks through how a specific type of injury claim is commonly evaluated, what documentation tends to matter, and where misunderstandings often occur.
