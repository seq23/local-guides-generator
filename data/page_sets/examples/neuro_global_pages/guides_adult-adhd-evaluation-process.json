Not medical or psychological advice.</p>\n<h2>What this guide covers</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>What the term usually means</li>\n<li>Common steps and what to ask a provider</li>\n<li>How to use results responsibly</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bottom line</h2>\n<p>Use this as a question checklist and orientation. Work with qualified clinicians for individualized decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>What an adult ADHD evaluation actually includes</h2>\n<p>A comprehensive adult ADHD evaluation is more than a checklist. Most clinicians combine a structured clinical interview, standardized rating scales, a review of childhood and adult symptoms, and screening for conditions that can look similar (or occur alongside ADHD).</p>\n<p>You may be asked about attention, organization, impulsivity, time management, emotional regulation, sleep, and how symptoms show up across settings (work, school, relationships). Expect specific examples—your evaluator is trying to establish a consistent pattern, not a “good day/bad day” snapshot.</p>\n<h2>Typical steps and timeline</h2>\n<p>Intake + history: paperwork, symptom questionnaires, and a detailed interview (often 60–120 minutes).</p>\n<p>Collateral input: some providers request input from a partner, family member, or old school records—especially if childhood onset needs clarification.</p>\n<p>Assessment measures: depending on the clinic, this can range from rating scales to broader cognitive testing when the picture is complex.</p>\n<p>Feedback + plan: you should leave with a clear summary, diagnostic conclusion (or differential), and next steps (treatment options, accommodations, coaching, referrals).</p>\n<h2>What to bring</h2>\n<p>A list of current medications and supplements, prior diagnoses, and any past mental health or learning evaluations.</p>\n<p>Examples: a few real situations where attention or executive function problems created consequences (missed deadlines, repeated mistakes, conflict at home).</p>\n<p>If relevant: old report cards, standardized test history, or notes about childhood behavior patterns.</p>\n<h2>Red flags to avoid</h2>\n<p>“Instant diagnosis” without a real history review, and no screening for anxiety, depression, trauma, sleep disorders, substance use, or medical factors.</p>\n<p>No written summary or unclear criteria, leaving you without documentation if you later need workplace or school accommodations.</p>\n<p>High-pressure upsells or one-size-fits-all treatment recommendations.</p>\n<h2>Questions to ask providers</h2>\n<p>What diagnostic framework do you use for adult ADHD and how do you evaluate childhood onset?</p>\n<p>Do you screen for anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and substance use that can mimic ADHD symptoms?</p>\n<p>What does your report include and can it support accommodations if needed?</p>\n<p>If you don’t diagnose ADHD, what alternative explanations will you evaluate and document?</p>"
