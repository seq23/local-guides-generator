  "main_html": "<h2>TRT Injections vs. Gels: Differences, Tradeoffs, and How People Choose</h2>\n<p>Educational only. Not medical advice.</p>\n<p><strong>If you only read one thing:</strong> Pick the method you can follow consistently, with monitoring—your clinic should explain pros/cons for your goals and risk factors.</p>\n<h2>What this covers</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>What people usually mean by this topic</li>\n<li>Common tradeoffs and questions to ask a clinic</li>\n<li>Safety and expectation-setting</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bottom line</h2>\n<p>Injections and topical options can both work, but they differ in convenience, consistency, and side-effect profiles.</p>\n\n<h2>Why this topic matters</h2>\n<p>Good TRT care is mostly about decision quality and monitoring. The goal is to treat symptoms safely while watching labs and side effects over time.</p>\n<p>This guide is educational and designed to help you ask better questions before you start, or if you’re adjusting an existing protocol.</p>\n<h2>What to discuss with a clinician</h2>\n<p>Your baseline symptoms, goals, and relevant medical history (sleep apnea, clotting history, prostate history, fertility goals).</p>\n<p>Which formulation fits your lifestyle (injections, gels/creams, pellets) and why.</p>\n<p>A clear monitoring plan: which labs, how often, and what changes would trigger dose adjustments.</p>\n<h2>Monitoring basics</h2>\n<p>Most protocols include repeat testosterone levels, CBC/hematocrit, and a broader health panel tailored to your situation.</p>\n<p>Ask how the clinic tracks symptoms alongside labs—numbers matter, but so do blood pressure, sleep, mood, and energy.</p>\n<h2>Common pitfalls to avoid</h2>\n<p>Starting without baseline labs or without a follow-up schedule.</p>\n<p>Dose changes without documenting symptoms and lab timing.</p>\n<p>Ignoring sleep, stress, alcohol, and weight—these can drive fatigue and libido issues even when testosterone numbers look “good.”</p>\n<h2>Practical questions to bring to an appointment</h2>\n<p>What symptoms would make you reconsider TRT or pause treatment?</p>\n<p>How do you manage elevated hematocrit or acne/mood changes if they occur?</p>\n<p>What does my first 90 days look like—labs, check-ins, and decision points?</p>"
