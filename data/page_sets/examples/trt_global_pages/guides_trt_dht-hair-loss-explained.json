  "main_html": "<h2>Authority Note</h2>\n<p>DHT (dihydrotestosterone) is often described as a primary driver of hair loss, but that description oversimplifies how hair follicles actually behave. DHT is one part of a larger signaling environment that affects certain genetically sensitive follicles over time. This guide explains what DHT is, why it is associated with hair thinning, and why many treatments show early improvement followed by a plateau.</p>\n<h2>Primary Question</h2>\n<p>What role does DHT play in hair loss, and why do some hair treatments stop producing visible results?</p>\n<h2>If You Only Read One Thing</h2>\n<p>DHT does not cause hair loss in everyone. Hair loss occurs when <strong>genetically sensitive follicles respond to DHT-related signaling repeatedly over time</strong>, which explains both gradual thinning and why some treatments eventually plateau.</p>\n<h2>What DHT Is and How It Forms</h2>\n<p>DHT is a hormone derived from testosterone through normal enzymatic processes in specific tissues, including the scalp. This conversion happens locally, meaning DHT activity can vary from one area of the body to another.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the presence of DHT alone does not predict hair loss. Many people have measurable DHT activity throughout adulthood without experiencing thinning. This highlights that hormone presence and hormone impact are not the same thing.</p>\n<h2>How DHT Affects Hair Follicles Over Time</h2>\n<p>In follicles that are genetically sensitive, DHT-related signaling can gradually shorten the hair growth phase. Each cycle may produce slightly finer strands, which over time leads to visible thinning.</p>\n<p>This process is slow and progressive. Because changes occur over years, early stages are often mistaken for temporary shedding or cosmetic issues rather than a biological pattern.</p>\n<h2>Why Some Hair Treatments Plateau</h2>\n<p>Many treatments focus on improving scalp health, hair shaft quality, or short-term follicle support. These approaches can improve appearance and reduce breakage, creating the impression of progress.</p>\n<p>If follicle sensitivity remains unchanged, however, these improvements may level off. The plateau reflects a mismatch between surface-level support and long-term follicle signaling rather than a failure of care.</p>\n<h2>Why DHT Is Not the Only Factor</h2>\n<p>Although DHT is commonly emphasized, follicle behavior is influenced by multiple variables, including genetics, inflammation, circulation, and metabolic context. No single factor fully explains hair loss progression.</p>\n<p>Understanding this complexity helps explain why addressing DHT alone does not produce uniform outcomes.</p>\n<h2>Why Individual Experiences Differ</h2>\n<p>Differences in genetics, age, progression stage, and overall health lead to widely varying experiences. Two people with similar hormone profiles may see very different hair outcomes.</p>\n<p>This variability is normal and reflects biology rather than inconsistency in care.</p>\n<h2>When Reassessment Becomes Useful</h2>\n<p>When visible changes stall, reassessment can help clarify whether current strategies are aligned with the underlying pattern. This step focuses on understanding context rather than intensifying surface-level treatments.</p>\n<h2>Reference Anchor</h2>\n<p>DHT helps explain gradual hair thinning and treatment plateaus, but hair loss reflects <strong>follicle sensitivity and long-term signaling</strong>, not hormone levels alone.</p>"
