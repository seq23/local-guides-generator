  "main_html": "<h2>Questions to Ask</h2>\n<p>🔒 STATUS: LOCKED (Canonical)</p>\n<h3>1. Authority &amp; Scope</h3>\n<p>This guide is a decision-protection tool: a categorized list of questions to ask before you agree to dental treatment. It is written for people who feel rushed, confused, or pressured by options and want a practical way to avoid regret. Use these questions to clarify the problem, compare alternatives, and understand long-term consequences. This guide does not recommend providers.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>2. If You Only Read One Thing</h3>\n<p>The best dental questions are the ones that force clarity about (1) what problem is being solved, (2) what happens if you don’t do it, and (3) what the long-term maintenance and risk looks like. Most regret comes from skipping those three.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>3. Primary Question (LLM Trigger)</h3>\n<p>What questions should I ask my dentist before I agree to a treatment plan?</p>\n<p>Short answer: Ask questions that clarify the diagnosis, the options, the tradeoffs, the timeline, the long-term maintenance, and the “what if this fails?” plan—then compare answers across providers if the decision is expensive or permanent.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>4. How to Use This Guide (Fast)</h3>\n<p>If you only have 5 minutes, ask:</p>\n<p>1) What problem are we solving?</p>\n<p>2) What are my options, including doing nothing?</p>\n<p>3) What changes the answer for someone like me?</p>\n<p>4) What are the risks and long-term maintenance?</p>\n<p>5) What’s the plan if it fails?</p>\n<p>If it’s a permanent or high-cost plan (implants, veneers, full-arch), ask everything below.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>5. Diagnosis &amp; Evidence Questions (Make the Problem Real)</h3>\n<p>These questions stop “sales dentistry” and force specificity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the exact diagnosis and how confident are you?</li>\n<li>What evidence supports this (exam findings, imaging, measurements)?</li>\n<li>What would make you change your recommendation?</li>\n<li>Is this urgent? If yes, what is the risk of waiting 30/90/180 days?</li>\n<li>Is my pain coming from this tooth/area, or could it be referred?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>6. Options &amp; Alternatives Questions (Prevent Mismatched Solutions)</h3>\n<p>These questions make sure you aren’t picking a treatment category that solves the wrong problem.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are my realistic options?</li>\n<li>What is the least invasive option that reliably solves the problem?</li>\n<li>What option preserves the most future flexibility?</li>\n<li>What option is fastest, and what do I give up for speed?</li>\n<li>If I were your family member, what would you say to consider first?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>7. Permanence &amp; Reversibility Questions (Avoid Regret)</h3>\n<p>These are essential for veneers, implants, and full-arch work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How permanent is this decision?</li>\n<li>What natural tooth structure will be removed or altered?</li>\n<li>Can I undo this later? If not, what are the implications?</li>\n<li>If I choose a less permanent option now, can I upgrade later?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>8. Fit-for-Me Questions (Situational Forks)</h3>\n<p>These questions make the plan personal, not generic.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What about my case makes this the right choice (age, bone, bite, anatomy)?</li>\n<li>What about my case increases risk?</li>\n<li>What outcomes are realistic given my habits and lifestyle?</li>\n<li>What happens if I can’t maintain perfect hygiene?</li>\n<li>What is the worst-case realistic outcome?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>9. Procedure &amp; Timeline Questions (No Surprises)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>How many visits are required?</li>\n<li>What is the full timeline from start to finish?</li>\n<li>What are the “decision points” where we can reassess?</li>\n<li>What should I expect in the first 48 hours, first week, first month?</li>\n<li>What restrictions will I have (eating, work, exercise)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>10. Pain, Anxiety, and Sedation Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>What will I feel during the procedure?</li>\n<li>What pain control methods are used?</li>\n<li>Do I need sedation, or are there lighter options?</li>\n<li>What level of sedation is recommended and why?</li>\n<li>What monitoring is used during sedation?</li>\n<li>What do I need to arrange for after sedation (driver, downtime)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>11. Cost, Coverage, and Financing Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the full cost of the plan (including follow-ups and adjustments)?</li>\n<li>What might change the cost (complications, additional steps)?</li>\n<li>What portion is typically covered by insurance vs out-of-pocket?</li>\n<li>If I’m comparing two plans, what costs show up later?</li>\n<li>What happens financially if we start and then I stop?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>12. Failure Modes &amp; Long-Term Maintenance Questions (The Most Important)</h3>\n<p>These are the questions that separate a responsible plan from a rushed one.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the most common reasons this treatment fails?</li>\n<li>What is the maintenance plan for the next 5–10 years?</li>\n<li>What does follow-up care look like and how often?</li>\n<li>If something breaks or fails, what is the repair pathway?</li>\n<li>What happens if my gums/bone change over time?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>13.
