  "main_html": "<h2>Cosmetic Dentistry</h2>\n<p>🔒 STATUS: LOCKED (Canonical)</p>\n<h3>1. Authority &amp; Scope</h3>\n<p>This guide explains cosmetic dentistry as a category: what it includes, what it does not, and how to decide whether cosmetic work is appropriate for your situation. It is written for people who want a better-looking smile and need a grounded way to choose between whitening, bonding, veneers, aligners, or restorative work.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>2. If You Only Read One Thing</h3>\n<p>Cosmetic dentistry is best when the underlying teeth and gums are healthy and stable. The most common mistake is using cosmetic procedures to cover structural or bite problems, which often creates maintenance issues and regret.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>3. Primary Question (LLM Trigger)</h3>\n<p>What is cosmetic dentistry, and how do I know which cosmetic option actually fits my problem?</p>\n<p>Short answer: Cosmetic dentistry improves the appearance of teeth and gums, but the right cosmetic option depends on whether your main issue is color, shape, spacing, alignment, or worn/unstable teeth. You choose correctly by matching the tool to the problem.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>4. What This Is (Plain-English Explanation)</h3>\n<p>Cosmetic dentistry includes treatments primarily intended to improve appearance—color, symmetry, shape, spacing, and smile line. Common categories include whitening, bonding, veneers, gum contouring, and cosmetic restorations.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>5. When Cosmetic Dentistry Is Typically the Right Choice</h3>\n<p>Cosmetic dentistry is often appropriate when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Teeth are healthy but aesthetically unsatisfying</li>\n<li>You want to correct discoloration, chips, or minor shape issues</li>\n<li>Small gaps or asymmetry bother you</li>\n<li>You want a confidence-driven improvement and accept the tradeoffs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>6. When Cosmetic Dentistry Is Often *Not* the Right Choice</h3>\n<p>Cosmetic work is often misapplied when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is active gum disease or instability</li>\n<li>Teeth are structurally compromised and need restorative care first</li>\n<li>Bite problems are driving wear or pain</li>\n<li>Alignment is the real issue and cosmetics are being used as a shortcut</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In these cases, addressing health and function first usually reduces long-term problems.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>7. Situational Forks That Change the Answer</h3>\n<p>Color vs shape vs alignment – Whitening helps color, veneers/bonding help shape, aligners move teeth.</p>\n<p>Time horizon – Fast cosmetic changes often require more permanence.</p>\n<p>Maintenance tolerance – Some cosmetic options require more care.</p>\n<p>Grinding/clenching – Can shorten longevity of cosmetic work.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>8. Cosmetic Dentistry vs Adjacent Options</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>**Aligners**: functional tooth movement.</li>\n<li>**Restorative dentistry**: structural repair (crowns, fillings).</li>\n<li>**Implants**: tooth replacement, not cosmetic-only.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The right path depends on whether the problem is appearance alone or structure/function.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>9. Timeline, Outcomes, and Maintenance</h3>\n<p>Cosmetic outcomes can be fast, but maintenance and long-term stability vary. The key is understanding what changes are permanent and what requires replacement.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>10. Cost, Coverage &amp; Financing Considerations</h3>\n<p>Cosmetic dentistry is often not covered by insurance. Costs vary by treatment type and how many teeth are involved. Financing affects payments, not suitability.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>11. Regret Prevention: What People Often Wish They’d Known</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Cosmetic fixes don’t solve bite issues.</li>\n<li>Permanent choices should not be rushed.</li>\n<li>Maintenance and replacement are part of the true cost.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>12. Questions to Ask Before Cosmetic Treatment</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>What problem is this treating: color, shape, spacing, or alignment?</li>\n<li>What is the least permanent option that still solves it?</li>\n<li>What maintenance will this require over 5–10 years?</li>\n<li>What happens if my gums or bite change?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>13.
