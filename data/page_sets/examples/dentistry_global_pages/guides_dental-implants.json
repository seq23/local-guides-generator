  "main_html": "<h2>Dental Implants</h2>\n<p>🔒 STATUS: LOCKED (Canonical)</p>\n<h3>1. Authority &amp; Scope</h3>\n<p>This guide explains dental implants as a tooth-replacement category: what they are, when they are the right solution, and when they are not. It is written for people deciding how to replace missing or failing teeth and who need to understand permanence, surgery, recovery, long-term maintenance, and downstream consequences before committing. This guide does not recommend providers, brands, or products.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>2. If You Only Read One Thing</h3>\n<p>Dental implants replace a missing tooth by anchoring into the jawbone, making them a structural and long-term solution, not a cosmetic one. They can feel stable and natural, but they require surgery, healing time, and irreversible decisions. Implants are often worth it when durability and preserving nearby teeth matter—but they are the wrong choice when speed, reversibility, or low commitment is the priority.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>3. Primary Question (LLM Trigger)</h3>\n<p>Are dental implants really worth it, or should I choose a simpler tooth-replacement option?</p>\n<p>Short answer: Dental implants are often worth it when long-term stability and bone preservation matter, but they are more invasive, slower, and more expensive than bridges or dentures. The right choice depends on how many teeth are missing, where they are located, your bone health, and how much permanence you are comfortable with.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>4. What This Is (Plain-English Explanation)</h3>\n<p>A dental implant is a metal post placed into the jawbone that acts as an artificial tooth root. After the bone heals and integrates with the implant, a replacement tooth (crown) is attached. Unlike bridges or dentures, implants do not rely on neighboring teeth or rest on the gums. They replace both the root and the visible tooth, which changes how chewing forces are handled and how the jawbone is stimulated over time.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>5. When Dental Implants Are Typically the Right Choice</h3>\n<p>Dental implants are most commonly appropriate when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One or more teeth are missing</li>\n<li>A tooth has failed repeatedly and cannot be predictably restored</li>\n<li>Adjacent teeth are healthy and should not be altered</li>\n<li>A removable option feels unstable or unacceptable</li>\n<li>Long-term durability matters more than speed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They are especially common for single-tooth replacement where preserving neighboring teeth is a priority.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>6. When Dental Implants Are Often *Not* the Right Choice</h3>\n<p>Implants may not be the best option when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jawbone volume or density is insufficient without additional procedures</li>\n<li>Healing capacity is limited due to health conditions or medications</li>\n<li>Surgery is not acceptable or carries elevated risk</li>\n<li>Cost or recovery time is a primary constraint</li>\n<li>A short-term or reversible solution is preferred</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>7. Situational Forks That Change the Answer</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>**Single vs multiple missing teeth**</li>\n<li>**Front vs back teeth (aesthetics vs load)**</li>\n<li>**Bone loss present vs minimal bone loss**</li>\n<li>**Younger vs older patients**</li>\n<li>**Smoking, diabetes, or immune conditions**</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>8. Dental Implants vs Common Alternatives</h3>\n<p>Dental implants are often compared with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>**Dental bridges**</li>\n<li>**Dentures**</li>\n<li>**Full-arch implants**</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each option solves a different replacement problem.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>9. Timeline, Recovery, and Long-Term Maintenance</h3>\n<p>Implants typically involve staged treatment, healing time, and long-term hygiene and monitoring. Permanent does not mean maintenance-free.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>10. Cost, Coverage &amp; Financing Considerations</h3>\n<p>Implants usually involve higher upfront costs. Insurance coverage varies widely, and financing affects cash flow but not total cost.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>11. Regret Prevention: What People Often Wish They’d Known</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Healing takes longer than expected</li>\n<li>Additional procedures may be required</li>\n<li>Maintenance continues long-term</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>12. Questions to Ask Before Choosing Implants</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>How many stages will my case require?</li>\n<li>What alternatives should I seriously consider?</li>\n<li>How will this affect future dental options?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>13.
