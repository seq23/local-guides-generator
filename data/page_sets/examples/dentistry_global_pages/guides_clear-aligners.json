Braces are often better when movements are complex, bite correction is needed, or consistent wear is uncertain.</p>\n    </div>\n  </details>\n\n  <details class=\"accordion\" id=\"clear-aligners-s4\">\n    <summary>\n      <span>What This Is (Plain-English Explanation)</span>\n      <span class=\"accordion-meta\">Section 4</span>\n    </summary>\n    <div class=\"accordion-panel\">\n<p>Clear aligners are a series of custom-made, removable plastic trays designed to gradually move teeth into alignment. Each set applies small, controlled forces to teeth over time. Unlike braces, aligners can be removed for eating and cleaning, which changes both convenience and responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n  </details>\n\n  <details class=\"accordion\" id=\"clear-aligners-s5\">\n    <summary>\n      <span>When Clear Aligners Are Typically the Right Choice</span>\n      <span class=\"accordion-meta\">Section 5</span>\n    </summary>\n    <div class=\"accordion-panel\">\n<p>Clear aligners are commonly appropriate when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Teeth are mildly to moderately crowded or spaced</li>\n<li>Cosmetic discretion matters at work or school</li>\n<li>Oral hygiene needs to be maintained easily</li>\n<li>The bite does not require major correction</li>\n<li>The wearer can commit to consistent daily use</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They are also frequently used to correct <strong>orthodontic relapse</strong> after prior braces.</p>\n    </div>\n  </details>\n\n  <details class=\"accordion\" id=\"clear-aligners-s6\">\n    <summary>\n      <span>When Clear Aligners Are Often <em>Not</em> the Right Choice</span>\n      <span class=\"accordion-meta\">Section 6</span>\n    </summary>\n    <div class=\"accordion-panel\">\n<p>Aligners may not be the best option when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Significant bite correction is required</li>\n<li>Teeth need complex rotations or vertical movement</li>\n<li>Jaw alignment issues are present</li>\n<li>Trays cannot be worn consistently</li>\n<li>Supervised in-office adjustments are critical</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In these cases, braces or other orthodontic approaches may be more predictable.</p>\n    </div>\n  </details>\n\n  <details class=\"accordion\" id=\"clear-aligners-s7\">\n    <summary>\n      <span>Situational Forks That Change the Answer</span>\n      <span class=\"accordion-meta\">Section 7</span>\n    </summary>\n    <div class=\"accordion-panel\">\n<p>Several real-world factors change whether aligners are a good fit:</p>\n<p><strong>Adults vs teens</strong> – Compliance expectations differ.</p>\n<p><strong>Cosmetic goals vs functional goals</strong> – Aligners favor cosmetic alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Relapse vs first-time treatment</strong> – Relapse cases are often simpler.</p>\n<p><strong>Lifestyle and discipline</strong> – Removability is an advantage only if used correctly.</p>\n    </div>\n  </details>\n\n  <details class=\"accordion\" id=\"clear-aligners-s8\">\n    <summary>\n      <span>Clear Aligners vs Common Alternatives</span>\n      <span class=\"accordion-meta\">Section 8</span>\n    </summary>\n    <div class=\"accordion-panel\">\n<p>Clear aligners are often compared with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Traditional braces</strong>, which allow more precise control</li>\n<li><strong>Veneers</strong>, which change appearance but not position</li>\n<li><strong>No treatment</strong>, when alignment issues are minor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each option addresses different priorities.</p>\n    </div>\n  </details>\n\n  <details class=\"accordion\" id=\"clear-aligners-s9\">\n    <summary>\n      <span>Timeline, Maintenance, and Long-Term Considerations</span>\n      <span class=\"accordion-meta\">Section 9</span>\n    </summary>\n    <div class=\"accordion-panel\">\n<p>Aligner treatment typically takes months, not weeks.
