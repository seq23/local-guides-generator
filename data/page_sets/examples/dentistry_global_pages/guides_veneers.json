  "main_html": "<h2>Veneers</h2>\n<p>🔒 STATUS: LOCKED (Canonical)</p>\n<h3>1. Authority &amp; Scope</h3>\n<p>This guide explains veneers as a cosmetic dentistry option: what they do, when they are appropriate, and when they are not a substitute for orthodontic or restorative care. It is written for people considering veneers to change the appearance of their teeth and who want to avoid permanent decisions they may regret.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>2. If You Only Read One Thing</h3>\n<p>Veneers can dramatically improve appearance, but they are typically permanent because they often require enamel removal. Veneers change how teeth look—not how teeth are positioned or how your bite works. They are best for appearance-focused problems on otherwise healthy teeth.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>3. Primary Question (LLM Trigger)</h3>\n<p>Are veneers a good alternative to braces or clear aligners?</p>\n<p>Short answer: Veneers can change how teeth look but do not move teeth or correct bite issues. If your main problem is alignment, veneers are usually not the correct substitute.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>4. What This Is (Plain-English Explanation)</h3>\n<p>Veneers are thin shells bonded to the front surface of teeth to change color, shape, size, or symmetry. Preparing teeth for veneers often involves removing a small amount of enamel so the veneer sits naturally.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>5. When Veneers Are Typically the Right Choice</h3>\n<p>Veneers are commonly appropriate when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Teeth are healthy but cosmetically imperfect</li>\n<li>Discoloration does not respond to whitening</li>\n<li>Chips, worn edges, or shape differences are the main issue</li>\n<li>Small gaps or asymmetry are cosmetic concerns</li>\n<li>You want a relatively fast appearance change and accept permanence</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>6. When Veneers Are Often *Not* the Right Choice</h3>\n<p>Veneers are often a poor choice when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Teeth are significantly misaligned</li>\n<li>Bite issues exist (functional problems)</li>\n<li>Teeth are structurally compromised (large fillings, decay)</li>\n<li>Gum disease or instability is present</li>\n<li>You strongly prefer reversible treatment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using veneers to “hide” alignment can create long-term maintenance or bite problems.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>7. Situational Forks That Change the Answer</h3>\n<p>Age and long-term horizon – Veneers may need replacement over time; younger patients face more lifetime replacements.</p>\n<p>Enamel thickness – Thin enamel can limit veneer suitability.</p>\n<p>Alignment severity – Veneers can camouflage small issues, not correct true misalignment.</p>\n<p>Grinding/clenching – Increases risk of chipping and shortens longevity.</p>\n<p>Gum stability – Changes in gumline can alter aesthetic outcomes.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>8. Veneers vs Adjacent Options</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>**Clear aligners**: move teeth; slower, more functional.</li>\n<li>**Cosmetic bonding**: more reversible but less durable.</li>\n<li>**Crowns**: more structural coverage when teeth are compromised.</li>\n<li>**Whitening**: best when color is the primary issue and enamel is healthy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>9. Longevity, Maintenance, and Replacement</h3>\n<p>Veneers can last many years, but they are not “one-and-done.” Maintenance includes careful hygiene, avoiding certain biting habits, and planning for potential replacement. If a veneer chips or fails, repair pathways vary by situation.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>10. Cost, Coverage &amp; Financing Considerations</h3>\n<p>Veneers are usually not covered by insurance because they are cosmetic. Costs vary by number of teeth, complexity, and aesthetic goals. Financing may be available, but the decision should be based on fit, not payments.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>11. Regret Prevention: What People Often Wish They’d Known</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Veneers are typically permanent.</li>\n<li>Replacement may be required later.</li>\n<li>Underlying alignment and bite issues still exist.</li>\n<li>Long-term maintenance matters as much as the initial result.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>12. Questions to Ask Before Choosing Veneers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>How much enamel will be removed?</li>\n<li>Are my teeth structurally healthy enough for veneers?</li>\n<li>What alternatives preserve reversibility (aligners, bonding)?</li>\n<li>How long do you expect veneers to last in my case?</li>\n<li>What happens if I chip one or want changes later?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>13.
