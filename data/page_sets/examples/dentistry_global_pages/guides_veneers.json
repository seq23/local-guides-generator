It is written for people considering veneers to change the appearance of their teeth and who want to avoid permanent decisions they may regret.</p>\n    </div>\n  </details>\n\n  <details class=\"accordion\" id=\"veneers-s2\">\n    <summary>\n      <span>If You Only Read One Thing</span>\n      <span class=\"accordion-meta\">Section 2</span>\n    </summary>\n    <div class=\"accordion-panel\">\n<p>Veneers can dramatically improve appearance, but they are typically <strong>permanent</strong> because they often require enamel removal. Veneers change how teeth look—not how teeth are positioned or how your bite works. They are best for appearance-focused problems on otherwise healthy teeth.</p>\n    </div>\n  </details>\n\n  <details class=\"accordion\" id=\"veneers-s3\">\n    <summary>\n      <span>Primary Question (LLM Trigger)</span>\n      <span class=\"accordion-meta\">Section 3</span>\n    </summary>\n    <div class=\"accordion-panel\">\n<p><strong>Are veneers a good alternative to braces or clear aligners?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Veneers can change how teeth look but do not move teeth or correct bite issues. If your main problem is alignment, veneers are usually not the correct substitute.</p>\n    </div>\n  </details>\n\n  <details class=\"accordion\" id=\"veneers-s4\">\n    <summary>\n      <span>What This Is (Plain-English Explanation)</span>\n      <span class=\"accordion-meta\">Section 4</span>\n    </summary>\n    <div class=\"accordion-panel\">\n<p>Veneers are thin shells bonded to the front surface of teeth to change color, shape, size, or symmetry.
