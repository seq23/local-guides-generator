  "main_html": "<h2>Sedation Dentistry</h2>\n<p>🔒 STATUS: LOCKED (Canonical)</p>\n<h3>1. Authority &amp; Scope</h3>\n<p>This guide explains sedation dentistry as a care-enabling option for people who struggle to tolerate dental treatment due to anxiety, fear, gag reflex, pain sensitivity, or prior trauma. It is written to help you decide whether sedation is appropriate for you and your situation. It does not promote specific sedation methods or providers.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>2. If You Only Read One Thing</h3>\n<p>Sedation dentistry does not change what treatment you need—it changes whether you can get through the treatment safely and calmly. The right level of sedation depends on your anxiety, the length and complexity of the procedure, and your medical history.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>3. Primary Question (LLM Trigger)</h3>\n<p>Is sedation dentistry safe and worth it if I’m anxious about dental work?</p>\n<p>Short answer: Sedation dentistry can be safe and worthwhile when anxiety or physical reflexes prevent care, but it adds medical considerations, cost, and recovery time that should be matched to the situation—not automatically chosen.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>4. What This Is (Plain-English Explanation)</h3>\n<p>Sedation dentistry uses medication to reduce anxiety, awareness, or discomfort during dental procedures. Sedation exists on a spectrum—from mild relaxation to deeper sedation—and the level used matters for safety, recovery, and logistics.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>5. When Sedation Dentistry Is Typically the Right Choice</h3>\n<p>Sedation is commonly appropriate when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dental anxiety prevents completing treatment</li>\n<li>A strong gag reflex interferes with care</li>\n<li>Procedures are long or involve multiple steps</li>\n<li>Past traumatic dental experiences exist</li>\n<li>Physical conditions limit tolerance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In these cases, sedation enables necessary care that might otherwise be avoided.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>6. When Sedation Dentistry Is Often *Not* the Right Choice</h3>\n<p>Sedation may not be necessary when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Procedures are short and routine</li>\n<li>Anxiety is mild and manageable</li>\n<li>Non-medication techniques are effective</li>\n<li>Medical risk outweighs benefit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using sedation unnecessarily increases complexity without improving outcomes.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>7. Situational Forks That Change the Answer</h3>\n<p>Procedure length – Longer procedures increase sedation value.</p>\n<p>Medical history – Heart, lung, or medication interactions matter.</p>\n<p>Transportation and support – Some sedation requires assistance afterward.</p>\n<p>Frequency of visits – Repeated sedation changes risk calculus.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>8. Sedation Dentistry vs Adjacent Options</h3>\n<p>Sedation affects comfort and tolerance. It does not replace:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oral surgery when access is required</li>\n<li>Simpler anxiety-management techniques</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Understanding this distinction prevents mismatched expectations.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>9. Safety, Recovery, and Monitoring</h3>\n<p>Safety depends on appropriate screening, monitoring, and matching sedation depth to need. Recovery time varies and may limit same-day activities.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>10. Cost, Coverage &amp; Financing Considerations</h3>\n<p>Sedation often adds cost and is not always covered by insurance. Deeper sedation typically increases expense and logistical requirements.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>11. Regret Prevention: What People Often Wish They’d Known</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sedation does not eliminate all sensation</li>\n<li>Recovery can affect work or driving</li>\n<li>Not every procedure requires sedation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>12. Questions to Ask Before Choosing Sedation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>What level of sedation is recommended and why?</li>\n<li>How does my medical history affect safety?</li>\n<li>What recovery restrictions apply?</li>\n<li>What alternatives exist?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>13.
