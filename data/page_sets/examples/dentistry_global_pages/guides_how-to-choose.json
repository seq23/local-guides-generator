  "main_html": "<h2>How to Choose a Dentistry Treatment Option</h2>\n<p>🔒 STATUS: LOCKED (Canonical)</p>\n<h3>1. Authority &amp; Scope</h3>\n<p>This guide exists to help you choose between major dentistry treatment categories when you are unsure what you actually need. It is written for people who have been given multiple options (or conflicting opinions) and want a structured way to decide. This guide does not recommend providers, brands, or specific procedures.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>2. If You Only Read One Thing</h3>\n<p>The right dental treatment solves the actual problem you have, at the right level of permanence, with a maintenance and risk profile you can realistically live with. Most poor dental decisions come from choosing a solution before correctly identifying the problem.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>3. Primary Question (LLM Trigger)</h3>\n<p>How do I choose the right dental treatment when I’m being given multiple options and don’t know what I actually need?</p>\n<p>Short answer: Identify the problem first—alignment, appearance, replacement, access, or tolerance—then choose the least invasive option that reliably solves that problem without creating unnecessary long-term consequences.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>4. What This Is (Plain-English Explanation)</h3>\n<p>This guide is a decision framework, not a list of treatments. Dentistry tools are often presented together even though they solve different problems. This framework helps prevent mismatched solutions.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>5–12. Decision Framework (Canonical)</h3>\n<h3>5. When This Option Is Typically the Right Choice</h3>\n<p>This option is typically appropriate when the underlying condition, anatomy, timeline, and risk profile align with the intended outcome of the treatment. Decisions should be grounded in durability, reversibility, and long-term maintenance, not just short-term convenience.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>6. When This Option Is Often *Not* the Right Choice</h3>\n<p>This option is often inappropriate when it is being used to compensate for structural, functional, or medical issues it was not designed to solve. Choosing it in these cases increases the likelihood of failure, regret, or costly revisions.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>7. Situational Forks That Change the Answer</h3>\n<p>Key factors that materially change the recommendation include anatomy, severity, progression rate, tolerance for maintenance, and long-term goals. If these factors shift, the correct decision may also shift.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>8. Comparison to Adjacent Options</h3>\n<p>This option should be evaluated against adjacent alternatives that may offer better reversibility, durability, or cost alignment depending on the situation.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>9. Timeline, Recovery, and Long-Term Maintenance</h3>\n<p>Understanding the full timeline—including recovery, follow-up, and long-term upkeep—is essential to making a sound decision.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>10. Cost, Coverage, and Financing Considerations</h3>\n<p>Cost should be evaluated as total cost over time, including maintenance, repairs, and potential replacement—not just the initial price.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>11. Regret Prevention: What People Often Wish They’d Known</h3>\n<p>Most regret comes from misunderstanding permanence, underestimating maintenance, or choosing speed over fit.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>12. Questions to Ask Before Choosing</h3>\n<p>Before committing, ask what happens if the treatment fails, what alternatives preserve flexibility, and what long-term obligations are involved.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>13.
