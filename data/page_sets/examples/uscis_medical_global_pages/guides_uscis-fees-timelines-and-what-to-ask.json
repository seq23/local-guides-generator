It does not give legal or medical advice. USCIS rules can change. Only USCIS and civil surgeons decide what applies to your case.</p>\n<p><h2>Why People Ask About Fees and Timelines</h2></p>\n<p>Many people want to understand costs and timing before scheduling an exam. Asking general questions helps set expectations.</p>\n<p>This guide lists common questions people ask, not advice.</p>\n<p><h2>Common Questions About Fees</h2></p>\n<p>People often ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What does the exam fee include?</li>\n<li>Are tests included in the price?</li>\n<li>When is payment due?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clinics explain their own policies.</p>\n<p><h2>Common Questions About Timing</h2></p>\n<p>People also ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long does the appointment usually take?</li>\n<li>When is Form I-693 completed?</li>\n<li>How long does USCIS review the form?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Only USCIS controls application timelines.</p>\n<p><h2>What Questions Cannot Do</h2></p>\n<p>Asking questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does not change USCIS rules</li>\n<li>Does not guarantee faster processing</li>\n<li>Does not affect outcomes</li>\n</ul>\n<p><h2>Spanish Summary (Optional)</h2></p>\n<details>\n<summary>Haga clic para leer el resumen en español ▼</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>Las personas suelen preguntar sobre costos y tiempos.</li>\n<li>Cada consultorio tiene sus propias reglas.</li>\n<li>USCIS controla el proceso.</li>\n<li>Hacer preguntas no garantiza resultados.</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p>\n<p>Questions about fees and timelines can help with planning. USCIS makes all final decisions about immigration cases.</p>\n\n<h2>What this guide covers</h2>\n<p>USCIS rules can change and local clinic processes vary. This guide is meant to help you prepare, reduce delays, and avoid common paperwork mistakes.</p>\n<p>Always confirm requirements with official USCIS instructions and your civil surgeon’s office.</p>\n<h2>Timelines and planning</h2>\n<p>Ask your clinic how long it typically takes to schedule, complete lab work, and finalize the sealed I‑693 packet (if they provide it).</p>\n<p>If you have upcoming filing deadlines, schedule early—vaccinations, missing records, or lab results can add time.</p>\n<h2>Questions to ask the civil surgeon’s office</h2>\n<p>What documents do you need from me before the appointment?</p>\n<p>Do you offer required vaccines on site, and what are the costs?</p>\n<p>How do you handle missing immunization records or prior TB testing?</p>\n<p>How and when do I receive the completed I‑693 (sealed), and what are your reissue policies if it’s lost or damaged?</p>\n<h2>Common mistakes that cause delays</h2>\n<p>Arriving without ID, missing vaccination records, or incomplete forms.</p>\n<p>Not clarifying payment structure up front (exam fee vs labs vs vaccines).</p>\n<p>Opening the sealed envelope if you receive one—always follow the clinic’s instructions.</p>"
