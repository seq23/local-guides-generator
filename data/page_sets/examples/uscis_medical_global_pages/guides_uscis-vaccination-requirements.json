  "main_html": "<h2>USCIS Vaccination Requirements: General Information</h2>\n<p><h2>Important Note</h2></p>\n<p>This page is for general information only. Vaccination rules can change. Only USCIS and a civil surgeon decide what applies to your case.</p>\n<p><h2>Why Vaccinations Are Reviewed</h2></p>\n<p>USCIS reviews vaccination information as part of the medical exam. This helps meet public health rules set by the U.S. government.</p>\n<p><h2>How Vaccination Information Is Collected</h2></p>\n<p>Civil surgeons review:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vaccination records you provide</li>\n<li>Tests or evaluations required by USCIS guidance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not all vaccines apply to every person. Age and medical history matter.</p>\n<p><h2>Missing Records</h2></p>\n<p>If you do not have vaccination records, the civil surgeon explains what steps may be available under USCIS instructions. Options vary.</p>\n<p><h2>Medical Exceptions</h2></p>\n<p>Some people may qualify for medical exceptions. Only the civil surgeon can review and document this information following USCIS rules.</p>\n<p><h2>Common Misunderstandings</h2></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Everyone needs the same vaccines.\" Requirements vary.</li>\n<li>\"Vaccines guarantee approval.\" USCIS makes all decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><h2>Spanish Summary (Optional)</h2></p>\n<details>\n<summary>Haga clic para leer el resumen en español ▼</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>USCIS revisa información de vacunas.</li>\n<li>No todas las vacunas aplican a todas las personas.</li>\n<li>Un médico autorizado revisa los requisitos.</li>\n<li>USCIS toma la decisión final.</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p>\n<p>Vaccination information is part of the USCIS medical exam. Requirements vary, and USCIS decides how information is used.</p>\n\n<h2>What this guide covers</h2>\n<p>USCIS rules can change and local clinic processes vary. This guide is meant to help you prepare, reduce delays, and avoid common paperwork mistakes.</p>\n<p>Always confirm requirements with official USCIS instructions and your civil surgeon’s office.</p>\n<h2>Timelines and planning</h2>\n<p>Ask your clinic how long it typically takes to schedule, complete lab work, and finalize the sealed I‑693 packet (if they provide it).</p>\n<p>If you have upcoming filing deadlines, schedule early—vaccinations, missing records, or lab results can add time.</p>\n<h2>Questions to ask the civil surgeon’s office</h2>\n<p>What documents do you need from me before the appointment?</p>\n<p>Do you offer required vaccines on site, and what are the costs?</p>\n<p>How do you handle missing immunization records or prior TB testing?</p>\n<p>How and when do I receive the completed I‑693 (sealed), and what are your reissue policies if it’s lost or damaged?</p>\n<h2>Common mistakes that cause delays</h2>\n<p>Arriving without ID, missing vaccination records, or incomplete forms.</p>\n<p>Not clarifying payment structure up front (exam fee vs labs vs vaccines).</p>\n<p>Opening the sealed envelope if you receive one—always follow the clinic’s instructions.</p>"
