Evaluations focus on whether a dangerous condition existed and whether the property owner knew or should have known about it.</p>\n</ul>\n<p>People consult lawyers because responsibility often depends on evidence that is not visible after the fact. Cleaning logs, inspection schedules, surveillance footage, and prior complaints may be relevant but are usually controlled by the property owner. Without understanding how these factors are evaluated, injured individuals may underestimate the importance of early documentation.</p>\n<p>Another key aspect is timing. Evaluators often ask how long a hazard existed and whether there was a reasonable opportunity to address it. This makes photographs, witness statements, and incident reports particularly significant.</p>\n<p>Slip and fall evaluations also consider the injured person’s actions, footwear, and path of travel. These factors are commonly raised and can influence comparative responsibility analysis.</p>\n<p>Immediate Priorities After a Slip and Fall</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seek medical evaluation</li>\n<li>Photograph the hazard</li>\n<li>Report the incident to property management</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Medical Evaluation and Documentation (Claim Impact)</p>\n<p>Falls frequently cause fractures and head injuries.</p>\n<p>How Slip and Fall Claims Typically Progress</p>\n<p>1.
