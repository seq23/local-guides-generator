Evaluations often depend on why the injured person was on the property and what duty of care applied in that context.</p>\n<p>People consult lawyers because visitor status—such as invitee, licensee, or trespasser—can materially affect how responsibility is assessed. These distinctions are not intuitive and are often misunderstood by injured individuals.</p>\n<p>Premises evaluations also focus on foreseeability and maintenance practices. Property owners may be evaluated on whether hazards were predictable, whether inspections were conducted, and whether corrective actions were reasonable.</p>\n<p>Evidence such as incident reports, maintenance records, photographs, and witness accounts plays a central role. Because these materials may be controlled by the property owner, understanding how evaluation works often drives early consultation.</p>\n<p>Immediate Priorities After a Premises Injury</p>\n<ul><li>Seek medical care</li><li>Document conditions</li><li>Identify witnesses</li></ul>\n<h2>Medical Evaluation and Documentation (Claim Impact)</h2><p>Injuries vary widely depending on conditions.</p>\n<h2>How Premises Liability Claims Typically Progress</h2><p>1.
