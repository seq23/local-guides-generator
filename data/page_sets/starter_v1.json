      {
        "q": "Can advertising influence editorial content?",
        "a": "No. Advertising placements are labeled “Advertising” and are intended to be visually separate from editorial content."

        "q": "What sources should I trust first?",
        "a": "Start with official sources (state licensing boards, agency sites, and primary documentation) and verify any claims independently."

      {
        "q": "Who is the best provider in {{city}}?",
        "a": "There isn’t one best for everyone. We do not rank or endorse providers. Shortlist options and compare verification, scope, pricing transparency, policies, and fit for your situation."
      },
      {
        "q": "How much does this service cost in {{city}}?",
        "a": "Costs vary widely based on scope and complexity. Get itemized, written quotes and compare the same scope across providers."

      },
      {
        "q": "Do you list every provider in {{city}}?",
        "a": "No. Directories may be incomplete and informational only. We do not rank or endorse providers. Providers can request updates via the contact page."
      },
      {
        "q": "How do I avoid scams in {{city}}?",
        "a": "Verify identity and licensing using official sources, insist on written scope + pricing, avoid pressure tactics, and be cautious with unusual payment requests."
      },
      {
        "q": "What should be in a written quote in {{city}}?",
        "a": "An itemized scope, itemized price, assumptions, exclusions, and the conditions that trigger add-ons or changes."
      },
      {
        "q": "Should I get more than one opinion in {{city}}?",
        "a": "For complex, high-cost, or high-stakes decisions, getting multiple opinions or quotes can reduce errors and improve fit."
      },
      {
        "q": "How do I file a complaint in {{stateName}}?",
