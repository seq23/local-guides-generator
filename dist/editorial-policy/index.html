      <h1>Editorial Policy</h1>
      <p>
        The Accident Guides is an educational publishing platform.
        This editorial policy explains how content is created, reviewed,
        and maintained across the site.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Purpose of Content</h2>
      <p>
        All content published on The Accident Guides is intended for
        general educational and informational purposes only.
        The site is designed to help readers understand common steps,
        timelines, and considerations following accidents or injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content is written in plain language and structured to reduce
        confusion during stressful situations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>No Legal or Medical Advice</h2>
      <p>
        The Accident Guides does not provide legal advice, medical advice,
        or case-specific guidance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing on this site should be interpreted as creating an
        attorney-client, doctor-patient, or professional advisory
        relationship of any kind.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
      <p>
        Educational content is developed independently of advertising
        and sponsorship arrangements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advertisers and sponsors do not influence editorial topics,
        wording, structure, or guidance.
        Sponsored placements are clearly labeled and visually distinct
        from editorial content.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sources and Accuracy</h2>
      <p>
        Content is based on publicly available information, general
        industry knowledge, and commonly understood practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        We aim for accuracy and clarity, but information may not reflect
        every individual circumstance or recent legal or regulatory change.
        Readers are encouraged to verify details with qualified professionals.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Updates and Revisions</h2>
      <p>
        Content may be reviewed and updated periodically to improve clarity,
        reflect changes in general practices, or address reader feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        Updates do not alter the educational nature of the content and
        do not constitute advice or recommendations.
