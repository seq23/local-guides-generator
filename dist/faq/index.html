  <p class="lede">Educational answers to common accident and personal injury questions. We do not provide legal advice, and we do not rank or endorse lawyers or firms.</p>
</section>

<section class="faq">
  <h2>Choosing a personal injury lawyer</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Who is the best personal injury lawyer?</dt>
    <dd>There isn’t one “best” lawyer for everyone. The right choice depends on your accident type, injuries, insurance limits, and whether litigation is likely. Use a neutral checklist: verify licensing, confirm relevant experience, review fee terms in writing, ask who handles the case day-to-day, and assess responsiveness.</dd>

    <dt>Who are the top personal injury lawyers?</dt>
    <dd>“Top” is subjective and we do not publish rankings. Instead, shortlist several firms that serve your area and practice in your case type, verify licensing with the official state attorney directory, and compare communication, case strategy, and clarity on fees and costs.</dd>

    <dt>Which lawyer wins the most money?</dt>
    <dd>Past results are not a promise of future outcomes. Outcomes vary based on liability, medical evidence, insurance limits, venue, and many other factors. Prioritize case fit, willingness to litigate when needed, and clear explanations of risks, timelines, and costs.</dd>

    <dt>What questions should I ask a lawyer before signing?</dt>
    <dd>Ask: (1) Who will handle my case daily? (2) What is your fee and how are case costs handled? (3) Have you handled similar cases? (4) What’s the expected timeline? (5) What happens if we need to file a lawsuit? (6) How will you communicate updates?</dd>

    <dt>How do I verify an attorney is licensed?</dt>
    <dd>Use the official attorney directory for the state where the lawyer is licensed. You can also ask for the lawyer’s bar number and confirm their status and any discipline history in the public record.</dd>
  </dl>
</section>

<section class="faq">
  <h2>After an accident</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>What should I do immediately after an accident?</dt>
    <dd>Prioritize safety and medical care. Document what happened, exchange information, and preserve evidence. See our step-by-step guides for common accident types in <a href="/guides/">Guides</a>.</dd>

    <dt>Do I need medical care even if I feel okay?</dt>
    <dd>Many injuries are delayed or masked by adrenaline. This site does not provide medical advice; consider getting evaluated by a licensed clinician, especially if symptoms appear later.</dd>

    <dt>How long does a typical injury claim take?</dt>
    <dd>Timelines vary widely based on injury severity, treatment length, liability disputes, and insurer behavior. See <a href="/guides/claim-timeline/">Claim Timeline</a> for common phases and what affects duration.</dd>
