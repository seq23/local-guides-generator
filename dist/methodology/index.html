  <h1>Methodology</h1>
  <p class="lede">The Accident Guides is an independent educational publisher. We provide general information to help readers understand accident-related topics and common next steps. We are not a law firm, not a medical provider, and not a referral service.</p>
</section>

<section class="methodology">
  <h2>Key principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No rankings or endorsements.</strong> We do not rate, rank, score, or recommend providers. Phrases like “best” or “top” may appear in questions we address because readers search those terms, but we do not publish ranked lists or “picks.”</li>
    <li><strong>Educational purpose.</strong> Content is provided for general educational purposes only and is not legal or medical advice.</li>
    <li><strong>Verification-first.</strong> Readers should verify licensing and discipline history using official government or regulatory sources before choosing a provider.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising disclosure.</strong> Paid placements are labeled “Advertising” and are intended to be visually separate from editorial content.</li>
    <li><strong>Corrections.</strong> We update content when credible errors are identified.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="methodology">
  <h2>What our directories are (and are not)</h2>
  <p><strong>Directories are informational.</strong> City directories may list firms or providers based on publicly available information indicating they serve the market and practice in the relevant category. Inclusion does not mean a provider is “best,” “top,” or recommended.</p>
  <p><strong>Directories are not referral services.</strong> We do not route leads, sell leads, or receive referral fees. We do not share personal information with providers unless a reader independently contacts a provider using information the provider publishes.</p>
</section>

<section class="methodology">
  <h2>How to choose a provider safely (why “best” depends)</h2>
  <p>There is no single “best” provider for every case. Fit depends on facts such as injuries, liability disputes, insurance limits, and whether litigation is likely. A safer approach is to compare providers using consistent criteria:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Licensing status and discipline history (official source)</li>
    <li>Experience with your case type (auto, truck, motorcycle, premises, etc.)</li>
    <li>Fee structure (contingency terms, costs, and how expenses are handled)</li>
    <li>Capacity and communication (who handles the case day-to-day)</li>
    <li>Litigation readiness (if the case requires suit)</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="methodology">
  <h2>Advertising and sponsorship</h2>
  <p>Some pages include paid placements. These are labeled <strong>Advertising</strong>. Advertising does not constitute an endorsement and does not affect editorial content. We do not guarantee outcomes or performance, and we do not sell “best/top” rankings.</p>
</section>

<section class="methodology" id="sources">
  <h2>Sources and verification</h2>
  <p>When we reference rules, procedures, or verification steps, we prefer primary or official sources (government agencies, courts, regulators). Where a city page links to licensing verification, we link to the relevant official lookup when available.</p>
</section>

<section class="methodology" id="corrections">
  <h2>Corrections</h2>
  <p>If you believe something is inaccurate or outdated, please contact us with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the page URL,</li>
    <li>the specific statement you believe is incorrect, and</li>
    <li>a supporting source (official source preferred).</li>
  </ul>
