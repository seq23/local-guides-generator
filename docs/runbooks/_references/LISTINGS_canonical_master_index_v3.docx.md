This is system law.

---

## **8.1 Personal Injury (Directory Model)**

### **City-Level Sponsor**

When a firm sponsors a city:

They may choose **one** of:

1. **Exclusive City Sponsor**  
   * Directory removed  
   * Replaced with:  
     * Sponsored firm profile  
     * CTA / contact flow

---

### **⛔ END OF BATCH 3**

(Page Flow Contracts \+ Sponsor Matrix)

Continuing.  
Same constraints: **full rewrite, cleaner prose, identical law, no deletions.**  
This is **Batch 4**.

---

# **10\. OPERATIONS & HUMAN ACCESS CONTROL (VA-SAFE SYSTEM)**

This system is designed so that **humans cannot accidentally break it**.

Every role has:

* Explicit permissions  
* Explicit prohibitions  
* Escalation rules

If a task is not explicitly allowed, it is forbidden.

---

## **10.1 Roles Defined**

### **Owner (You)**

The only role that may:

* Change system law  
* Modify canonical templates  
* Approve sponsorship overrides  
* Unlock frozen files  
* Change validation logic

---

### **Operator (Trusted Senior)**

May:

2. Leave a comment  
3. Escalate to Operator or Owner

No improvisation is allowed.

---

# **11\. CHANGE CONTROL & VERSIONING LAW**

This system uses **software-grade governance**.

---

## **11.1 Frozen vs Mutable Files**

### **Frozen Files (Locked)**

* Evaluation frameworks  
* Page templates  
* Disclosure language  
* Validation rules  
* Canonical page flow spec

These files:

* May not be edited casually  
* Require explicit unlock \+ version bump

---

### **Mutable Files**

* City configs  
* Provider lists  
* Example lists  
* FAQs  
* Sponsorship flags

These may change freely **within rules**.

---

## **11.2 Versioning Rules**

Every material change must:

* Increment version  
* Record date  
* Record reason  
* Record author

No silent edits.

---

## **11.3 Never Rewrite, Only Add**

Evaluation frameworks follow this rule:

* Never rewrite wholesale  
* Only append or clarify  
* Preserve original structure

AI trusts **stable patterns**.

---

# **12\. AI VISIBILITY LAW (WHY THIS WORKS)**

This system is optimized for **answer extraction**, not traffic.

---

## **12.1 Definition of AI Visibility**

AI visibility means:

* AI reuses your **decision frameworks**  
* AI mirrors your **neutral language**  
* AI does not invent its own structure

You win when AI explains decisions **the way your site does**.

---

## **12.2 Why Rankings Fail**

Rankings:

* Require constant updates  
* Are suppressed by AI  
* Create compliance risk  
* Destroy neutrality

Your system avoids all four.

---

## **12.3 Monitoring Protocol (Lightweight)**

Monthly, per vertical:

1. Ask 2–3 canonical questions in ChatGPT  
2. Look for:  
   * Process language  
   * Neutral framing  
   * Absence of rankings  
3. Ask:  
   “Where does this information usually come from?”

If AI invents new steps → add clarifying copy  
If AI mirrors your framework → do nothing

---

# **13\. DISCLOSURE & COMPLIANCE (NON-OPTIONAL)**

Disclosures protect:

* You  
* Sponsors  
* Platforms  
* AI usage

---

## **13.1 Disclosure Placement**

Disclosures must appear:

* On all city pages  
* On all state pages  
* On all vertical landing pages

Never hidden. Never removed.

---

## **13.2 Disclosure Content Rules**

Disclosures must state:

* Informational purpose  
* No guarantees  
* No endorsements  
* Sponsorship transparency  
* Jurisdictional variance

No legal advice. No medical advice.

---

## **13.3 Sponsored Content Disclosure**

If sponsorship affects content:

* It must be disclosed  
* It must be visible  
* It must be unambiguous

Hidden sponsorship is forbidden.

---

# **14\. GUIDES SYSTEM (CANONICAL)**

Guides are **education assets**, not monetization assets.

---

## **14.1 Purpose of Guides**

Guides exist to:

* Deepen AI reference value  
* Answer long-form questions  
* Reduce repetition on city pages

---

## **14.2 Guides Linking Rules**

* State pages: **micro-block only**  
* City pages: **micro-block above directory**  
* Non-PI pages: full guides block

Guides are never embedded inline.

---

## **14.3 Guides Are Neutral**

* No providers  
* No CTAs  
* No sponsors  
* No rankings

Pure explanation.

---

### **⛔ END OF BATCH 4**

(Operations, Governance, AI Law, Guides)

---

# **15\. MONETIZATION SYSTEM (CANONICAL, NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

These are **always removable**.

---

### **When a Non-PI Sponsor Pays**

They may:

* Replace examples entirely  
* Convert page to single-provider spotlight

---

## **15.4 Sponsorship Flags (System Control)**

All monetization actions are controlled via flags.

Examples:

* `has_city_sponsor`  
* `has_state_sponsor`  
* `has_global_sponsor`  
* `directory_override`  
* `example_override`

No hard-coded logic.  
No manual hacks.

---

# **16\. NEXT STEPS SYSTEM (DUAL-TRACK)**

There are **two separate Next Steps flows**.

They must never be conflated.

---

## **16.1 User-Facing Next Steps (Public)**

Purpose:

* Help users act  
* Route inquiries appropriately

Appears on:

* City pages  
* State pages (PI only)

Behavior:

* If sponsor exists → route to sponsor  
* If no sponsor → neutral routing

Examples:

* “Get help now”  
* “Talk to a professional”

---

## **16.2 Sponsor-Facing Next Steps (Internal)**

Purpose:

* Onboard sponsors  
* Capture preferences  
* Control visibility

Includes:

* Intake form  
* Ad copy submission  
* CTA preferences  
* Tracking options  
* Scope selection (city / state / global)

This flow:

* Is never public  
* Lives as an ops workflow

---

## **16.3 Separation Rule (Critical)**

User Next Steps ≠ Sponsor Onboarding.

They must:

* Use different endpoints  
* Use different language  
* Never appear together

---

# **17\. PAGE FLOW LAW (CANONICAL ORDER)**

Page flow is **locked system law**.

---

## **17.1 PI City Page Flow (Authoritative)**

2. **Top Ad Slot**  
3. AI Visibility / Evaluation Framework  
4. **Mid Ad Slot**  
5. Guides Micro-Block  
6. City Grid  
7. Disclosure / Footer

No directories on state pages.

## **17.3 Non-PI City Page Flow**

1. Hero / Intro  
2. **Top Ad Slot**  
3. AI Visibility Framework  
4. **Mid Ad Slot**  
5. Guides Block (full)  
6. Example Providers (if any)  
7. FAQs  
8. Disclosure / Footer

---

# **18\. DUPLICATE CONTENT PREVENTION**

Duplicate content is a hard failure.

---

## **18.1 What Must Be Unique**

* City intros  
* City context paragraphs  
* Jurisdictional notes  
* Local considerations

---

## **18.2 What May Be Reused**

* Evaluation frameworks  
* Disclosure language  
* Structural blocks  
* Guides

Reuse structure, not prose.

---

# **19\. EDGE CASES & OVERRIDES**

Edge cases are expected.  
They are handled explicitly.

---

## **19.1 Low-Population Cities**

If a city cannot support:

* Directory depth  
* Example variety

Then:

* Use minimum viable listings  
* Do not fabricate  
* Do not pad

---

## **19.2 Sponsor Conflict Resolution**

Priority order:

1. Global sponsor  
2. State sponsor  
3. City sponsor

Higher scope overrides lower scope.

---

## **19.3 Temporary Suppression**

Pages may temporarily:

* Hide directories  
* Hide examples  
* Hide ads

Reasons:

* Compliance  
* Sponsor transition  
* Legal review

Suppression ≠ deletion.

---

# **20\. ENFORCEMENT SUMMARY (SYSTEM LAW)**

If a change violates:

* Page flow  
* Evaluation neutrality  
* Disclosure rules  
* Sponsorship transparency

It is invalid.

Rollback immediately.

---

## **Final Principle (Locked)**

**Content explains.**  
**Inventory monetizes.**  
**Structure protects.**

This system is:

* Defensible  
* Scalable  
* AI-legible  
* Sponsor-ready

---

### **⛔ END OF BATCH 5**

---

## **PART 1 — WHAT IS STILL MISSING (DIFF SUMMARY)**

Your current assembled document is **very strong**, but it is missing **five categories of system law that existed implicitly or partially in v2.1 and execution practice** but are **not yet fully codified** in the rewrite:

### **❌ Missing / Under-Specified Areas**

### **1\. State vs City Authority Resolution Rules**

You define state vs city flows, but you **do not define precedence rules** when:

* A state sponsor exists but a city sponsor does not  
* A city sponsor conflicts with a state sponsor  
* A global sponsor overrides both

➡️ This must be explicit system law.

---

### **2\. Directory Collapse Decision Tree (PI)**

You define *that* directory takeover exists, but **not**:

* When directory collapses vs stays  
* What minimum replacement modules must exist  
* What happens to guides \+ FAQs when directory is removed

➡️ This is a monetization-critical enforcement gap.

---

### **3\. Guide Coverage Sufficiency Rules (Per Page)**

You define guide systems globally, but you **do not define minimum guide presence per page type**:

* City page: how many guides must appear?  
* State page: must full guides appear or micro-only?  
* Non-PI city pages: when guides block is optional vs mandatory

➡️ This causes silent regressions later.

---

### **4\. Sponsor Inventory Exhaustion Rules**

There is **no rule** for:

* What happens when inventory is sold out  
* Whether ads rotate, queue, or reject new sponsors  
* Whether directory takeover blocks future ads

➡️ This *will* bite later without law.

---

### **5\. Cross-Vertical Drift Protection**

You define verticals individually, but you do **not** define:

* What PI features are *explicitly forbidden* from leaking into non-PI  
* What non-PI simplifications must never be added to PI

➡️ This is a regression magnet.

---

Everything else you included **is present and valid**. The problem is not omission volume — it’s **missing final authority edges**.

---

## **PART 2 — REQUIRED ADDENDUMS (VERBATIM, CANONICAL)**

Below are **drop-in sections**. You can append them as:

**APPENDIX Q, R, S, T, U**

No compression. No references. This closes the system.

---

## **🔒 APPENDIX Q — STATE vs CITY SPONSOR AUTHORITY RESOLUTION (LOCKED)**

### **Purpose**

Define non-ambiguous precedence rules when multiple sponsor scopes exist.

### **Authority Order (Highest → Lowest)**

1. **Global Sponsor**  
2. **State Sponsor**  
3. **City Sponsor**  
4. **Education-Only (No Sponsor)**

Higher authority **always overrides** lower authority unless explicitly constrained below.

---

### **Resolution Rules**

**If a Global Sponsor exists:**

* All city and state ad slots may be occupied by the global sponsor  
* Directory takeover (PI) may be applied globally  
* Lower-level sponsors may not appear unless explicitly whitelisted

**If a State Sponsor exists and no Global Sponsor:**

* State page top \+ mid slots are owned by the state sponsor  
* City pages in that state:  
  * Default: one slot (top OR mid) allocated to state sponsor  
  * Second slot remains available for city sponsor (if sold)

**If a City Sponsor exists and no higher sponsor:**

* City sponsor controls city page top \+ mid slots  
* No authority over state page

**Conflict Rule (Hard)**  
No page may render conflicting sponsor CTAs from different scopes in the same slot.

Validator requirement:

* Fail build if two sponsors claim the same slot on the same page.

---

## **🔒 APPENDIX R — PI DIRECTORY COLLAPSE & REPLACEMENT LAW (LOCKED)**

### **Directory Status Options (PI Only)**

Each PI city page must be in exactly **one** of the following states:

1. **Standard Directory (Default)**  
2. **Featured Sponsor Directory**  
3. **Collapsed Directory (Sponsor Takeover)**

---

### **1️⃣ Standard Directory**

* Exactly 5 firms  
* Alphabetical  
* No CTAs  
* Guides \+ FAQs remain unchanged

---

### **2️⃣ Featured Sponsor Directory**

* Sponsor may be visually highlighted  
* Directory still renders all firms  
* No reordering  
* Disclosure required

---

### **3️⃣ Collapsed Directory (Sponsor Takeover)**

When enabled:

* Directory module is **fully removed**  
* Replaced with **one sponsor module** containing:  
  * Firm name  
  * Official site link OR intake form  
  * Disclosure text

**Mandatory Preservation Rules**  
Even when directory is collapsed:

* AI Evaluation Framework remains  
* Guides Micro-Block remains  
* Full Guides Block remains  
* FAQs remain

❌ Removing guides or evaluation content is forbidden.

Validator requirement:

* Fail if directory is removed without sponsor replacement module.

---

## **🔒 APPENDIX S — GUIDE COVERAGE SUFFICIENCY RULES (LOCKED)**

### **Minimum Guide Presence by Page Type**

#### **PI City Pages**

Must include:

* Guides Micro-Block (required)  
* Full Guides Block (required)  
* Minimum 4 guides visible

#### **PI State Pages**

Must include:

* Guides Micro-Block (required)  
* Full Guides Block optional  
* Must link to /guides/

#### **Non-PI City Pages**

Must include:

* Guides Micro-Block (required)  
* Full Guides Block:  
  * Required if the vertical has ≥3 guides  
  * Optional otherwise

Validator requirement:

* Fail build if required guide blocks are missing.

---

## **🔒 APPENDIX T — SPONSOR INVENTORY EXHAUSTION LAW (LOCKED)**

### **Inventory Limits**

* City pages: max 1 sponsor per slot  
* State pages: max 1 sponsor per slot  
* Global: max 1 sponsor per slot

No rotation unless explicitly implemented later.

---

### **Exhaustion Rules**

If inventory is fully sold:

* Additional sponsor requests must be rejected or queued  
* No silent overrides  
* No forced replacement

Directory takeover (PI):

* Blocks additional directory-level sponsors  
* Does NOT block top/mid ad slots unless specified in contract

---

## **🔒 APPENDIX U — CROSS-VERTICAL DRIFT PROTECTION (LOCKED)**

### **PI-Only Features (Forbidden Elsewhere)**

The following may **never** appear outside PI:

* Directories  
* Firm counts  
* Directory takeovers  
* State-level firm logic

Validator requirement:

* Fail build if directory module appears in non-PI vertical.

---

### **Non-PI Simplifications (Forbidden in PI)**

The following may **never** replace PI features:

* Example-only language replacing directory logic  
* Removal of firm verification rules  
* Removal of state authority context

---

You’re right. It **is incomplete**, and here’s the straight answer why before I fix it properly:

What we built so far is **system law \+ page spec \+ monetization logic**.  
What’s missing is the **execution layer** — the part that lets a VA or operator safely *do work* without breaking the law.

That layer must exist, and it must be **boringly explicit**.

Below is a **full set of missing SOPs and checklists**, written so you can **paste them verbatim** into the master index as appendices.  
No prompts. No theory. This is the mechanical layer you’re feeling is absent.

---

# **🔒 APPENDIX V — NEW CITY LAUNCH SOP (VA-SAFE, LOCKED)**

## **Purpose**

Add a new city page to any vertical **without breaking AI visibility, monetization, or compliance**.

This SOP applies to:

* PI cities

  ---

  ## **STEP 0 — Pre-Flight (DO NOT SKIP)**

Before creating a city:

☐ City is approved in the Master City List  
☐ State already exists (or state SOP is followed first)  
☐ Vertical is approved and live  
☐ No conflicting sponsor contracts exist for this city

If any box fails → STOP and escalate.

---

## **STEP 1 — Create City Data File**

☐ Who it’s for  
☐ Typical process  
☐ What varies by city/state  
☐ Costs (neutral)  
☐ Red flags  
☐ Explicit “educational only” boundary

❌ No “best”, “top”, “recommended”

---

## **STEP 3 — Guide Inventory**

☐ At least 4 guides exist  
☐ Each answers a real user question  
☐ Guides are reusable across cities

---

## **STEP 4 — Template Wiring**

☐ Top ad slot  
☐ Evaluation framework token

☐ Example rules enforced (if non-PI)

---

# **🔒 APPENDIX X — VALIDATION SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS (LOCKED)**

Every build MUST fail if:

☐ Ads are adjacent  
☐ Evaluation framework missing or duplicated  
☐ PI directory appears in non-PI vertical  
☐ Listings missing required count  
☐ Sponsor takeover removes guides

☐ All validations pass  
☐ No new warnings introduced  
☐ Spot-check 1 PI city  
☐ Spot-check 1 non-PI city

If unsure → STOP.

---

# **🔒 APPENDIX Z — VA EXECUTION CHECKLIST (PRINTABLE)**

A VA may ONLY:

☐ Add cities using City SOP  
☐ Update examples lists  
☐ Fix broken links  
☐ Run validation

A VA may NEVER:

❌ Change templates  
❌ Move ad slots  
❌ Edit evaluation frameworks  
❌ Change sponsor logic  
❌ Touch validators

If uncertain → escalate.

---

# **🔒 APPENDIX AA — SPONSOR OPERATIONS SOP (LOCKED)**

## **Purpose**

Define exactly how sponsors are onboarded, configured, and enforced **without touching templates**.

Applies to:

## **STEP 1 — Sponsor Scope Lock**

Before any setup:

☐ Vertical confirmed  
☐ Scope confirmed:

☐ User path preserved

Disclosure is **never removable**.

---

## **STEP 5 — Activation**

---

# **🔒 APPENDIX AB — REGRESSION INCIDENT RESPONSE (LOCKED)**

## **Purpose**

Handle breakage **without panic or drift**.

---

## **INCIDENT TYPES**

### **Type 1 — Validation Failure**

Examples:

* Adjacent ads  
* Missing framework  
* Token error

**Response:**

1. Revert last commit  
2. Fix locally  
3. Re-run validation  
4. Re-deploy

---

### **Type 2 — Page Flow Drift**

Examples:

* Blocks reordered  
* Micro-block missing

**Response:**

1. Diff against Page Flow Spec  
2. Restore canonical order  
3. Add regression note

---

### **Type 3 — Sponsor Conflict**

Examples:

* Two sponsors claim same slot

**Response:**

1. Disable newer sponsor  
2. Escalate to ops  
3. No silent overrides

---

## **ABSOLUTE RULE**

Never “hotfix” templates in production.

---

# **🔒 APPENDIX AC — FROZEN FILES LIST (DO NOT TOUCH)**

These files are **system law**.

Any edit requires owner approval.

/scripts/validate\_\*.js

/templates/page\_city\_pi.\*

/templates/page\_state\_pi.\*

/templates/page\_city\_non\_pi.\*

/partials/eval\_framework.\*

/partials/guides\_micro\_block.\*

If a VA touches these → immediate rollback.

---

# **🔒 APPENDIX AD — VALIDATOR ↔ PAGE LAW MAP**

| Rule | Validator | Page |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Ads not adjacent | validate\_ads.js | City \+ State |
| Eval framework once | validate\_framework.js | City \+ State |
| PI directory only | validate\_vertical.js | PI only |
| Guides micro-block | validate\_guides.js | City \+ State |
| Sponsor override safe | validate\_sponsor.js | All |

If a rule exists → validator must exist.

---

# **🔒 APPENDIX AE — SYSTEM LAW QUICK REFERENCE (1 PAGE)**

**Listings is:**

* An explanation layer  
* Not a ranking engine  
* Not a recommendation engine

**We optimize for:**

* AI answer reuse  
* Sponsor inventory  
* Compliance durability

**Never do:**

* Rankings  
* Scores  
* Guarantees  
* “Best” language

**Everything routes through:**  
Evaluation → Monetization → Disclosure

---

# **🔒 APPENDIX AF — VA PERMISSION MATRIX (CANONICAL)**

| Action | VA | Owner |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Add city | ✅ |  |
| Add examples | ✅ |  |
| Fix links | ✅ |  |
| Run validation | ✅ |  |
| Move ads | ❌ | ✅ |
| Edit templates | ❌ | ✅ |
| Edit eval framework | ❌ | ✅ |
| Change sponsor logic | ❌ | ✅ |

---

# **🔒 APPENDIX AG — FULL DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST (FINAL GATE)**

☐ City SOP followed  
☐ Vertical SOP followed  
☐ Sponsor SOP followed (if applicable)  
☐ Validation clean  
☐ Manual spot-check  
☐ Commit message correct  
☐ Master Index updated

If all true → ship.

---

# **🔒 APPENDIX AH — “NEVER MISS” LIST (CATCH-ALL)**

Before declaring work “done,” confirm:

☐ Guides are linked  
☐ Micro-block exists  
☐ AI framework is neutral  
☐ Sponsor value is visible  
☐ User path is clear  
☐ Compliance language intact

If one fails → work is incomplete.

---

## **FINAL STATUS**

At this point, the system has:

* Canonical page law  
* Canonical monetization law  
* Canonical sponsor law  
* Canonical validation law  
* Canonical SOPs  
* Canonical VA boundaries  
* Canonical deployment gates  
* Canonical incident response

There are **no remaining recommendations**.

Anything new from here is a **deliberate system change**, not a missing piece.
