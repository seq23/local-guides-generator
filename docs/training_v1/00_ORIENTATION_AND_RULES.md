## Why This Exists

This business operates at the intersection of:
- compliance
- advertising
- SEO
- AI / LLM discovery
- paid sponsors

Small mistakes compound fast.

Your job is **not** to move quickly.
Your job is to move **correctly**.

## What This Business Is

- An **educational publishing system**
- Clearly labeled advertising
- No endorsements
- No rankings
- No recommendations

- neutral
- compliant
- transparent

## What This Business Is NOT

- A directory ranking providers
- A recommendation engine
- A lead broker
- A legal or medical advice platform

If you blur this line, the site becomes legally risky.

- Never guess.
- Never improvise.

If unsure → **STOP and escalate**.
