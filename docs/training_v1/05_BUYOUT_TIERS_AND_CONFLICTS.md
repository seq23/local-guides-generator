# Buyout tiers + conflicts (VA training)

This training doc teaches how to apply the buyout system without guessing. **It does not create new rules.** The "law" lives in:

- `docs/runbooks/monetization_ads_buyouts/00_BUYOUT_AND_INVENTORY_MODEL_CANONICAL.md`
- `docs/runbooks/monetization_ads_buyouts/01_CONFLICT_AND_HIERARCHY_RULES.md`

## Key concept: the Live Buyout CTA (runtime)

This is **not** the "for-providers" inquiry button.

When a **Vertical Pack Buyout** is LIVE, a universal CTA appears on eligible pages.

**CTA copy (LOCKED):**

> Speak directly with a vetted provider serving your location.

## What a VA should say to sponsors

- City/State/Guide buyouts = inventory exclusivity on those pages.
- Vertical Pack Buyout = exclusivity across the vertical, with deferred exclusions if lower-tier contracts already exist.
- When Vertical is LIVE, the site shows the Live Buyout CTA so users can speak with a vetted provider.
