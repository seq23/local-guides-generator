Below is a **true 1-page VA cheat sheet**, distilled from the Compliance Manual.
This is written to be **printable**, **skim-able**, and **executable without interpretation**.

# 🧾 VA COMPLIANCE CHEAT SHEET

**Applies to ALL Verticals (PI · Dentistry · TRT · Neuro · USCIS)**
**If unsure → STOP and escalate**

---

## 🚨 NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE

We are an **educational publisher** — **NOT** a law firm, medical provider, or referral service.

If content sounds like:

* a recommendation
* advice
* a guarantee
  …it is **not allowed**.

---

## ✅ THE 60-SECOND PREFLIGHT (RUN EVERY TIME)

Before publishing or editing **anything**, confirm **ALL** boxes:

### COPY & CLAIMS

* ☐ NO “best / top / #1 / recommended”
* ☐ NO guarantees or outcome promises
* ☐ NO “we vetted / we chose / trusted by us”
* ☐ Content framed as **education**, not advice

### ADS & SPONSORS

* ☐ Paid placements labeled **“Advertising”**
* ☐ Ads visually separate from editorial
* ☐ NO sponsored providers inside editorial lists

### DISCLOSURES

* ☐ Global footer present (do NOT add body disclaimers)
* ☐ Footer includes:

  * Educational only
  * No legal advice
  * No medical advice
  * No endorsement

### LINKS (REQUIRED)

* ☐ Editorial Policy
* ☐ Disclaimer
* ☐ Privacy Policy
* ☐ Official license / verification links (where applicable)

If ANY box fails → **STOP. DO NOT PUBLISH.**

---

## 🚫 ABSOLUTE BANNED LANGUAGE (ALL VERTICALS)

Never use:

* “best”
* “top”
* “#1”
* “guaranteed”
* “we recommend”
* “we vetted”
* “increase your settlement”
* “approval guaranteed”
* “cure / permanent / pain-free”

Even once = **compliance failure**.

## 🧠 SIMPLE RULE TO REMEMBER
