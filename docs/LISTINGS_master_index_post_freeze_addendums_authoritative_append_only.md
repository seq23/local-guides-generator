# 🔐 VERSION CONTROL & CHANGE AUTHORITY

**Document:** Master Index — Post-Freeze Addendums (v7)
**Status:** LOCKED (Append-Only; On-Shelf)
**Current Version:** **v7**
**Effective Date:** Immediately

---

## Versioning Rules (Authoritative)

1. This document is maintained as a **single living addendum**.
2. The **version number MUST be incremented** whenever:

   * New governance is added
   * Existing governance is clarified or expanded
   * Any rule affecting validation, monetization, page contracts, or vertical behavior is introduced
3. Version increments apply to the **entire document**, not individual sections.
4. Older versions are superseded upon export and replacement in project files.

---

## Lock / Unlock Semantics

* **LOCKED:**
  The document is authoritative, enforceable, and safe to execute against.

* **UNLOCKED:**
  The canvas may be amended, but changes do not take effect until:

  * The version number is incremented
  * The document is re-exported
  * The project file is replaced

---

## Enforcement Rule

Execution, validation, and repo changes MUST target **the highest exported version** of this document.

If the version referenced by an execution effort does not match the latest exported file, execution MUST pause.

---

## Governance Principle

* **Governance lives in canvases**
* **Execution lives in chats**
* **Canon lives in files**
* **Nothing important lives only in chat**

# Master Index — Post-Freeze Addendums (Authoritative, Append-Only)

## 🔒 PREAMBLE INHERITANCE & GOVERNING AUTHORITY

### Scope Clarification (v7)

This addendum defines **state-based governance only** (what must be true). Any procedural, sequential, or implementation-oriented language is **non-authoritative** and must be treated as execution guidance living outside this addendum.

Governance prevails over execution at all times. This document MUST NOT contain procedural instructions, implementation steps, repository changes, code, examples, or execution guidance; any content describing *how* to do work belongs exclusively in an Execution Playbook canvas and inclusion here constitutes a governance violation.

---

## Governance Declaration

This document inherits the **Master Index v2.1 preamble** as governing law.

The Master Index v2.1 is frozen and remains superior authority.

This addendum:

* Supplements v2.1 only
* Is append-only unless explicitly instructed otherwise
* Is policy-only
* Contains no execution steps, no code, and no examples

---

### Canonical Artifact Completeness Rule (v1.0)

**Canonical Artifact Completeness Rule (Hard Fail):**
Any document marked *Canonical* must be a fully self-contained, literal artifact and contain **no placeholders, stubs, editor notes, shorthand, or references to previously approved content** (e.g., “unchanged,” “same as above,” “TBD”). Violation is a hard fail and blocks locking and conversion.

---

### Machine-Only Marker & Accordion Convertibility Rule (v1.0)

**Machine-Only Marker & Accordion Convertibility Rule (Hard Fail):**
All canonical guide documents must contain valid machine-only markers for every guide and section, and must be directly convertible to JSON and HTML where each numbered section renders as a discrete accordion panel; missing markers, malformed markers, or non-convertible section structures constitute a hard fail.

# 🚨 MASTER INDEX ADDENDUM — PERSONAL INJURY (DISTRIBUTION VERTICAL & PHASE GOVERNANCE)

**Status:** LOCKED (Append-Only)

## I. STRATEGIC CLASSIFICATION (AUTHORITATIVE)

Personal Injury (PI) is a **Distribution Vertical**.

PI is explicitly excluded from Phase-1 sponsorship monetization and is not evaluated under the same criteria as TRT, Dentistry, USCIS, or other authority-based verticals.

PI advertisers purchase **control over intake and case flow**, not “authority sponsorship.” Therefore, PI “buyouts” are classified as **distribution contracts**, not sponsorships.

## II. MONETIZATION MODE ENUM (CANONICAL LAW)

The PI vertical MUST support a governance-level monetization mode enum:

* **EDUCATION_ONLY**
* **DISTRIBUTION_SPONSORED_DIRECTORY**
* **FULL_SITE_SPONSORSHIP**

A city’s monetization mode MUST be explicitly declared. Absence of a monetization mode is a validation failure.

## III. PHASE GOVERNANCE (LOCKED)

### Phase 1 — Foundation (Non-Monetized)

* Build and validate distribution scaffolding
* All cities remain EDUCATION_ONLY
* No sponsor-gated mechanisms permitted

### Phase 2 — Distribution (Primary PI Monetization Phase)

* Allowed monetization mode: DISTRIBUTION_SPONSORED_DIRECTORY
* Sponsored directory behavior is permitted only in Phase 2
* Sponsor-gated Next-Steps mechanisms are permitted only in Phase 2

**Phase-2 Intake Cities (Authorized Set):**

* Houston
* Chicago
* Atlanta
* Orlando
* Dallas

### Phase 3 — Full-Site Sponsorship (Optional / Non-Primary)

* FULL_SITE_SPONSORSHIP may be offered as an optional product
* Full-site sponsorship pricing may remain in the system (e.g., $75K), regardless of likelihood
* Phase 3 does not override Phase-2 distribution constraints unless explicitly amended

## IV. SPONSORED DIRECTORY BEHAVIOR (PHASE-2 LOCKED)

### Sponsored Placement Rules

When a city is in DISTRIBUTION_SPONSORED_DIRECTORY and sponsor state is live:

* The city directory remains present
* A single sponsored firm block renders at the top of the directory
* A CTA may appear only inside the sponsored firm block

### Directory Integrity Rules

* The directory MUST NOT be removed, hidden, or replaced
* Neutral directory entries remain present below the sponsored block
* No ranking, rating, or comparative ordering is permitted

## V. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

When a sponsored directory block is present, disclosure MUST appear immediately above it.

Disclosure MUST be concise and canonical (see Appendix H).

## VI. VALIDATION RULES (POLICY-LEVEL)

Validation MUST fail if:

* A city is missing an explicit monetization mode
* A sponsored block appears in EDUCATION_ONLY
* More than one sponsor appears live in a city
* A CTA appears outside the sponsored block
* Sponsor-gated Next-Steps exists when sponsor is not live
* Sponsor is live in Phase 2 but required sponsor surfaces are missing

## VII. GOVERNANCE GUARANTEE

PI distribution behavior MUST NOT be reused across verticals without an explicit addendum update.

---

# APPENDIX A — VA OPERATING SOP (AUTHORITATIVE)

**Status:** LOCKED

## I. PURPOSE

This SOP defines VA-authorized work within governed repos.

## II. AUTHORITY & BOUNDARIES

### VA Authority Includes

* Updating data files where explicitly instructed
* Running build + validation steps when provided
* Reporting diffs and failures

### VA Authority Explicitly Excludes

* Editing governance documents
* Introducing new routes, tokens, or mechanisms
* Changing sponsor/monetization logic

## III. REQUIRED ORDER OF OPERATIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. Read the current exported addendum version in project files
2. Confirm target vertical + cities + scope of change
3. Apply one batch of changes only (data-only, build-only, validator-only)
4. Run validation
5. Report results before proceeding

## IV. HARD STOP CONDITIONS (IMMEDIATE ESCALATION)

Stop and escalate if:

* Any validation failure occurs
* Any required artifact is missing
* Scope changes mid-batch

## V. DELIVERABLE STANDARDS

* No placeholders
* No “unchanged” references
* No partial files

## VI. GOVERNANCE GUARANTEE

VAs do not reinterpret policy. They execute only.

# APPENDIX B — QA SIGN-OFF CHECKLIST (CANONICAL)

**Status:** LOCKED

## I. PURPOSE

This checklist is the lock gate for any canonical guide.

## II. QA SIGN-OFF (PASS / FAIL)

### Layer 0 — Structural Integrity

*

### Layer 1 — Primary Question Alignment

*

### Layer 2 — Decision Completeness

*

### Layer 3 — Situational Specificity

*

### Layer 4 — LLM Extractability

*

### Layer 5 — Human Helpfulness

*

### Layer 6 — Authority & Depth

*

## III. SIGN-OFF RULE

A guide may be LOCKED only if all layers pass.

# APPENDIX C — VERTICAL LAUNCH SOP (AUTHORITATIVE)

**Status:** LOCKED

## I. PURPOSE

Defines the governance-compliant launch sequence for a new vertical.

## II. REQUIRED PHASES (ORDERED)

### Phase 1 — Canonical Authoring

### Phase 2 — QA & Lock

### Phase 3 — Conversion Preparation

### Phase 4 — Mechanical Conversion

### Phase 5 — Validation

### Phase 6 — Release

## III. HARD FAILURE CONDITIONS

* Canonical content not in Canvas
* Missing QA sign-off
* Conversion without sanity & syntax

## IV. GOVERNANCE GUARANTEE

Execution cannot override governance.

---

# APPENDIX D — DEFINITIONS & CANONICAL TERMS (AUTHORITATIVE)

**Status:** LOCKED

## I. PURPOSE

Unify critical terms so operators cannot reinterpret them.

## II. CANONICAL DEFINITIONS

* **Conversion**: Mechanical transform only.
* **Delivery**: Conversion + Sanity & Syntax PASS.
* **Canonical**: Fully self-contained, approved, and losslessly convertible.

## III. INTERPRETATION RULE

If multiple docs conflict, frozen Master Index v2.1 prevails.

---

# APPENDIX E — VALIDATOR & QA MAPPING (REFERENCE-ONLY, AUTHORITATIVE)

**Status:** LOCKED

## I. PURPOSE

Map QA layers to what validators can and cannot enforce.

## II. QA LAYER → VALIDATOR RESPONSIBILITY MAP

| QA Layer                          | What it tests                       | Validator Responsibility                    | Failure Type |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Layer 0 — Structural Integrity    | Required sections and markers exist | Enforce presence, order, markers            | Hard Fail    |
| Layer 1 — Primary Question        | Guide answers its core question     | Detect missing or unanswered title question | Hard Fail    |
| Layer 2 — Decision Completeness   | Decision logic is complete          | Flag missing required decision blocks       | Hard Fail    |
| Layer 3 — Situational Specificity | Scenario-resolved guidance          | Detect shell or generic patterns            | Hard Fail    |
| Layer 4 — LLM Extractability      | Self-contained, quotable logic      | Flag missing answer blocks                  | Hard Fail    |
| Layer 5 — Human Helpfulness       | Clarity and confidence              | Human QA only                               | Lock Blocker |
| Layer 6 — Authority & Depth       | Risk-appropriate depth              | Human QA only                               | Lock Blocker |

## III. REGRESSION PROTECTION

Validators must additionally support:

* Page type contract enforcement
* Required zone detection (FAQ, directory, guides block)
* Ad slot resolution checks
* Golden-city regression checks

Loss of any previously required structure is a catastrophic failure.

## IV. GOVERNANCE CLARIFICATION

Validators enforce structure and prevent silent regressions.

---

# APPENDIX F — CANONICAL LANGUAGE REGISTRY FRAMEWORK (UNIVERSAL)

**Status:** LOCKED (Append-Only)
**Applies to:** All current and future verticals
**Purpose:** Prevent cross-vertical language drift by making tone, CTA class, and sponsorship language deterministic.

## I. REQUIREMENT (HARD RULE)

Each vertical MUST maintain its own Canonical Language Registry.

Language, CTA framing, and sponsorship behavior MUST NOT be reused across verticals without an explicit addendum update.

Validators MAY enforce registry compliance in future versions.

## II. REQUIRED REGISTRY SECTIONS (ALL VERTICALS)

Each vertical registry MUST define:

1. Tone
2. Publisher Position (educational / informational / advisory / transactional)
3. Sponsorship Model(s) Allowed (ads-only / featured placement / exclusive city sponsor / full-site buyout / distribution contract)
4. CTA Class (choose ONE): informational / referral-light / intake-adjacent (PI-only unless explicitly extended)
5. Allowed Phrases (canonical short statements)
6. Disallowed Language (explicit list; non-negotiable)
7. Enforcement Rules (what must never appear; what must always appear when sponsor live)

---

# APPENDIX G — CANONICAL LANGUAGE REGISTRY (DENTISTRY)

**Status:** LOCKED (Append-Only)
**Applies to:** Dentistry vertical only
**Tone:** Consumer-friendly, non-legal, non-urgent
**Intent:** Education + choice clarity (not intake pressure)

Dentistry is not PI. The language must feel calm, consumer-first, comparison-safe, non-coercive.
No “next steps,” no urgency framing, no intake-adjacent pressure.

## A) Publisher & Education Clarity (Dentistry)

1. “This site provides educational information about dental care.”
2. “We do not provide medical or dental advice.”
3. “Always consult a licensed dental professional for diagnosis or treatment.”

## B) Listings & Directory Neutrality (Dentistry)

4. “Dental practices are listed for informational purposes only.”
5. “Listings are not ranked or rated.”
6. “Inclusion does not imply endorsement.”

## C) Sponsorship Transparency (Dentistry – lighter tone)

7. “Some placements may be paid advertisements.”
8. “Advertising does not influence educational content.”

## D) CTA Language (Dentistry)

Dentistry CTAs must remain choice-oriented, not funnel-oriented.

9. “Visit official website”
10. “Learn more about this practice”
11. “Contact the practice directly”

### Explicitly disallowed in Dentistry

* “Next steps”
* “Send inquiry”
* “Secure intake”
* “Get started now”

## Enforcement Rules (Dentistry)

* No intake funnels
* No form handoffs
* No single-firm exclusivity language
* No urgency framing
* No “we’ll connect you” language

Dentistry is browse → compare → choose, always.

---

# APPENDIX H — CANONICAL LANGUAGE REGISTRY (PERSONAL INJURY)

**Status:** LOCKED (Append-Only)
**Applies to:** PI vertical only
**Tone:** Intake-adjacent, legally defensive

## A) Publisher / Independence (PI)

1. “This site is an independent educational publisher.”
2. “We do not provide legal advice.”
3. “We do not guarantee outcomes.”
4. “Nothing on this site creates an attorney–client relationship.”
5. “Information is provided for general educational purposes only.”

## B) Sponsorship Transparency (Sponsor Live Only)

6. “This placement is paid advertising.”
7. “Sponsored placement does not imply endorsement.”
8. “Only one firm is featured in this sponsored placement.”
9. “Other providers may appear below in a neutral directory.”

## C) Directory Neutrality (PI)

10. “Listings are presented without ranking or comparison.”
11. “Providers are listed for informational purposes only.”
12. “We do not rate or rank providers.”

## D) Next Steps / Intake-Adjacent Clarity (PI)

13. “Next steps: send an inquiry to a real [CITY] personal injury firm.”
14. “You are leaving this site to contact a law firm directly.”
15. “Information you submit goes directly to the firm, not this publisher.”
16. “Submitting an inquiry does not obligate you to hire a firm.”

## E) CTA Microcopy (PI)

17. “Go to next steps”
18. “Send inquiry”
19. “Open secure inquiry form”
20. “Continue to firm intake”

**Freeze Rule:** All wording is frozen. No rewording without addendum update.

---

# APPENDIX I — CANONICAL LANGUAGE REGISTRIES (OTHER VERTICALS)

**Status:** DRAFT (Append-Only)

## Neuro / ADHD / Autism Evaluations (DRAFT)

Tone: Clinical, cautious, trust-forward.

## TRT / Medical Weight Loss / IV Hydration (DRAFT)

Tone: Informational + conversion-aware (non-legal).

## USCIS Medical (DRAFT)

Tone: Procedural, compliance-first.

---

# APPENDIX J — SPONSORSHIP / NEXT-STEPS MECHANISM CONTRACT (POLICY-LEVEL)

**Status:** LOCKED (Append-Only)

## I. MECHANISM DEFINITION

The Next-Steps Mechanism is a sponsor-gated route and CTA behavior that becomes available only when a city is in an approved monetization mode and sponsor state is live.

## II. STATE LAW (WHAT MUST BE TRUE)

* Sponsor live status must be explicit and complete (no partial sponsor objects).
* If sponsor is not live, Next-Steps MUST NOT exist.
* If sponsor is live and the city is in an approved monetization mode, Next-Steps MUST exist.

## III. DISCLOSURE PROXIMITY LAW

When the mechanism is live, required disclosure MUST appear immediately above the sponsored block or primary CTA surface, and MUST NOT appear elsewhere.

## IV. SINGLE-SPONSOR LAW

At most one sponsor may be live per city.

## V. EXTENSION CLAUSE (EXPLICIT)

This mechanism is authorized for PI only. Extending it to another vertical requires a governance update.

### END OF APPENDICES F–J

# SECTION X — SCALABLE SPONSOR + NEXT-STEPS ARCHITECTURE (ALL VERTICALS)

## Core Principle (Do Not Fork)

Do NOT copy/paste PI logic into other verticals.
Generalize the mechanism once in the base generator, then enable/shape it per vertical via pack config + per-city data.

## 1) Make Sponsor/Next-Steps Vertical-Agnostic (One-Time Engine Work)

**Goal:** Same engine; different copy/placement rules per vertical.

### Standard Sponsor Object Schema (Canonical Input Contract)

Use one sponsor object shape across all verticals (per-city truth lives in the city listing JSON):

Sponsor object:

* status: "live"
* firm_name: "..."
* official_site_url: "https://..."
* intake_url: "https://..."

### Generic Next-Steps Route Generator

* Create //next-steps/ ONLY when sponsor.status = live AND the vertical’s pack allows next-steps.
* Validation must FAIL if:

  * next-steps exists but sponsor is not live
  * sponsor is live (and next-steps is enabled) but next-steps is missing

### Generic CTA Injection Hook

* CTA rendering must be configurable per vertical (NOT hard-coded to PI).
* CTA placement options must be pack-driven (see §2).

## 2) Put Vertical-Specific Behavior in the Page-Set Pack (No Build Forks)

Each vertical pack (e.g., dentistry_v1.json, trt_v1.json, etc.) must own a sponsorship config block that controls:

* whether next-steps is enabled for this vertical
* where CTA appears (city hub only, directory module only, both)
* button copy (registry-backed)
* disclosure copy (registry-backed)
* directory behavior (embedded vs separate page, required vs optional)
* styling variant (table vs cards)

Result: Dentistry can use a different UX (e.g., “Request an appointment”) without inheriting PI intake language.

## 3) Keep Per-City Sponsor Truth in data/listings/.json

Operational scaling rule:

* Sales ops flips sponsor live status by editing ONE city file.
* Build output reflects it automatically.
* Validator prevents accidental leakage.

Dentistry/TRT/etc. can use the same sponsor object when a sponsor is sold—no new mechanism code.

## 4) Use data/sponsors/programs.json as the Product Catalog (Not Live Status)

Treat programs.json as a catalog of what can be sold and how it displays:

* what sponsorship products exist (directory sponsor, city sponsor, full-site buyout)
* what pages/slots each product affects
* what copy appears on /for-providers/
* pricing tables + inclusions

Critical separation:

* programs.json defines products + display.
* city listing JSON controls who is live.

## 5) Validation Strategy That Stays Maintainable

Validator design:

* Base validator checks universal invariants:

  * next-steps exists ⇄ sponsor live (when enabled)
  * disclosure proximity
  * no multiple sponsors per city
* Per-vertical rule set loads from pack config:

  * is next-steps enabled?
  * is CTA allowed on city hub? directory? both?
  * is directory embedded required/optional?

This preserves PI strictness without forcing other verticals into PI UX.

## Fastest Path Later (Lowest Work Sequence)

1. Extract PI sponsor/next-steps logic into a reusable module in build_city_sites.js (segment, don’t fork).
2. Add sponsorship config block to each pack JSON.
3. Update validator to read pack config and apply correct rule set.
4. Dentistry rollout becomes data-only: add sponsor stubs to dentistry cities + set ONE city sponsor live to test.
