# RELEASE INDEX (AUTHORITATIVE)

Append-only log of releases for the Listings / LKG generator.

Rules:
- Do not delete prior entries.
- Every release must record: tag, date/time, summary, validators passed, and whether any buyouts were LIVE.
- If a release is reverted, add a new entry describing the rollback.
