# 🔐 VERSION CONTROL & CHANGE AUTHORITY

**Document:** LISTINGS — Master Index Post-Freeze Addendum  
**Status:** 🔒 LOCKED (Authoritative — Updated)  
**Current Version:** v5  
**Effective Date:** 1-19-2026

---

# ============================== GOVERNANCE SPINE (AUTHORITATIVE)

This section defines the **governance spine** for this addendum. It establishes the authoritative reading order and scope of governance without restating policy.

If you are authoring, reviewing, or interpreting governance, you follow this spine. Content outside the spine provides detail or reference but does not override it.

## GOVERNANCE SPINE — ORDER OF AUTHORITY

**1. Version Control & Change Authority**  
Defines versioning, lock state, and enforcement semantics.

**2. Preamble & Authority**  
Establishes inheritance from Frozen Master Index v2.1 and conflict resolution.

**3. Canonical Content Governance (CFVP v1)**  
Governs canonical authoring, QA, locking, and conversion eligibility.

**4. Guide Identity, Slugs & Structure**  
Defines slugs as identity and per-vertical structural constraints.

**5. Vertical-Specific Governance**  
Authoritative rules, hubs, and slugs per vertical (PI, TRT, Dentistry, Neuro, USCIS).

**6. Conversion, Validation & Regression Governance**  
Defines validation obligations and catastrophic failure conditions.

**7. Language, Sponsorship & Operating Boundaries**  
Constrains language registries, monetization behavior, and VA authority.

**8. Definitions & Interpretation**  
Provides canonical terms and final conflict resolution.

---

## Versioning Rules

1. This document is a **single, living post-freeze addendum** to the frozen Master Index v2.1.
2. The version number MUST be incremented whenever:
   - New governance is added
   - Existing governance is clarified, expanded, or reorganized
   - Any rule affecting canonical content, validation, monetization, page contracts, or vertical behavior is introduced or modified
3. Versioning applies to the **entire document**, not individual sections.
4. Upon export, this document **supersedes all prior addendum versions**.

---

## Lock / Unlock Semantics

- **LOCKED** — The document is authoritative, enforceable, and safe to execute against.
- **UNLOCKED** — The document may be edited, but changes have no force until:
  - The version number is incremented
  - The document is re-exported
  - The project file is replaced

---

## Enforcement Rule

All execution, validation, and repository work MUST target the **highest exported version** of this addendum.  
If execution references an older version, work MUST pause.

---

## Governance Principles

- Governance lives in canvases
- Repo consolidation is **not** an implied governance requirement; it requires explicit addendum language when/if approved.
- Execution lives in chats and playbooks
- Canon lives in project files
- Nothing important lives only in chat

# 1. PREAMBLE & AUTHORITY

This document inherits the **Master Index v2.1 preamble** as superior governing law.

- Master Index v2.1 is frozen and cannot be modified.
- This addendum supplements v2.1 only.
- In the event of conflict, **v2.1 prevails**.

This document defines **state-based governance only**. It contains no procedural instructions, no implementation steps, no code, and no execution guidance.

---

# 2. CANONICAL CONTENT GOVERNANCE

## Canonical First Vertical Publishing (CFVP v1)

All guide authoring, QA, locking, and conversion across all verticals follows **Canonical First Vertical Publishing (CFVP v1)**.

CFVP v1 defines:
- a single canonical authoring surface per vertical
- immutable guide slugs as identity
- machine-only markers for lossless conversion
- QA gates prior to locking
- lock-before-conversion discipline

CFVP v1 is governed entirely within this addendum. No separate CFVP document exists or should be referenced elsewhere.

## CFVP v1 — Required Pre-Authoring Declarations (Hard Gate)

Before any CFVP authoring begins for a vertical, the canonical CFVP canvas MUST declare the following, at the top of the document, in plain language:

1. **Audience & Reading Level**
   - Target reading level (grade range)
   - Any audience constraints (e.g., ESL-heavy)

2. **Language Mode**
   - Primary language (authoritative)
   - Optional secondary language behavior (none / summary-only / full translation)
   - If secondary language exists, it must be clearly labeled as informational and must not drift from the primary content.

3. **Compliance Mode**
   - Standard / Elevated / Restricted
   - Restricted mode applies by default to immigration-adjacent and regulator-visible verticals.

4. **Sensitivity Tiering (Authoring Order Control)**
   - Identify any high-sensitivity topics (e.g., costs, timelines, outcomes).
   - High-sensitivity guides should be authored last within a vertical’s batch plan unless the vertical explicitly declares otherwise.

5. **Quantitative Targets**
   - Wordcount target range (if specified for the vertical)
   - Any fixed structural requirements (section count, required callouts, etc.)

These declarations do not override governance; they are a required *execution-visible* header to prevent constraint drift during authoring.



## Canonical Definition

Canonical content is fully self-contained, approved, immutable text that is losslessly convertible into machine-readable and human-readable formats.

## Canonical Artifact Completeness Rule (Hard Fail)

Any document marked Canonical must:
- Contain no placeholders, stubs, shorthand, or editor notes
- Contain no references such as “unchanged,” “same as above,” or “TBD”
- Be complete without reliance on prior approvals

Violation blocks locking and conversion.

## Machine-Only Marker & Convertibility Rule (Hard Fail)

All canonical guides must:
- Contain valid machine-only start/end markers per guide
- Use a numbered section structure convertible to JSON and HTML
- Render each numbered section as a discrete accordion panel

Malformed or missing markers constitute a hard fail.

## Canonical Durability & Execution Handoff

**Canonical Durability Requirement (Execution Gate)**

When introducing a **new vertical**, or making **structural canonical changes** (including slugs, hubs, per-guide skeletons, or vertical identity decisions), execution must strongly prefer the following sequence:

1. Insert the canonical changes into the **Master Index — Post-Freeze Addendum**
2. Export the updated addendum
3. Upload the exported file to **project files**

Execution may proceed **without export only as a temporary exception**, and only after explicitly acknowledging that:
- the canon currently lives only in canvas, and
- execution will pause again until the addendum is exported and uploaded

Canonical content that exists **only in chat or execution documents** is not considered durable and must not be assumed stable.

---

# 3. GUIDE IDENTITY, SLUGS & STRUCTURE

## Slugs as Identity

- Slugs are immutable identifiers

## Slug Source-of-Truth, Drift Handling, and Why Slugs Matter

- The **Master Index Addendum slug list** is the benchmark identity for each vertical.
- If execution work discovers additional slugs already present in a repo pack (post-lock reconciliation completed) (e.g., `guides_<slug>.json` files), authoring MAY proceed using those slugs **as a temporary bridge** *only if*:
  - the slugs are treated as immutable during authoring and conversion, and
  - the Master Index Addendum is updated after the authoring session to reconcile the benchmark slug list.
- Slugs matter because they are the stable identity that binds:
  - canonical guide blocks (GUIDE START/END markers),
  - output routes (e.g., `/guides/<slug>/`), and
  - machine extraction into JSON/HTML artifacts.

Any mismatch between canonical markers, routes, and extracted filenames is a conversion failure.


- Slug lists define the identity of a vertical’s guide corpus
- Renaming or deleting a slug requires a new addendum

## Guide Structure Requirements

Each guide must:
- Answer one primary user question
- Use a consistent numbered section structure
- Remain self-contained and decision-complete

### Per-Vertical Section Layout Flexibility

Each vertical MAY define its own canonical per-guide section layout.
That layout MUST be consistent within the vertical once defined.

---

# 4. QA, LOCKING & CANON APPROVAL

## QA Gate (All Must Pass)

1. Structural integrity (markers, sections, ordering)
2. Primary question realism
3. Decision completeness (right/wrong/forks/delay/regret)
4. Situational specificity
5. LLM extractability (quotable, declarative answers)
6. Human helpfulness
7. Authority-appropriate depth

### Quantitative QA Requirements (When a Vertical Declares Them)

If a vertical declares quantitative targets (e.g., a wordcount range, reading level, or multilingual summaries), QA MUST include explicit checks for:

- **Completeness:** No blank guides, no placeholder sections, no missing bodies between markers.
- **Wordcount:** Each guide must fall within the declared target range (if declared).
- **Readability:** The guide language must match the declared audience level; avoid internal jargon and editorial meta-phrasing.
- **Terminology hygiene:** Avoid internal labels that do not help users (example: do not introduce phrases like “Reference Anchor” unless the vertical explicitly defines them as user-facing headings).

Failure on any declared quantitative target blocks LOCK.


## Locking Semantics

- Guides may be marked LOCKED only after all QA layers pass
- Once LOCKED, no authorship is permitted
- Conversion may only occur from LOCKED canonical content

---

# 5. CONVERSION & VALIDATION GOVERNANCE

- Conversion is mechanical only

## Conversion Output Schema (Golden Benchmark Discipline)

When converting LOCKED canonical guides to machine artifacts, the output JSON must conform to the project’s **golden benchmark schema** for guide pages.

If an existing benchmark guide JSON is designated as the golden reference (e.g., a known-good PI guide), conversion outputs for other verticals must match that schema exactly (key names, required fields, and content placement).

Schema drift (missing keys, renamed keys, or alternate shapes) is a validation failure and blocks delivery.

- Canonical MD is immutable input
- Output formats include JSON and HTML
- Any structural loss or drift is a validation failure

---

# 6. VERTICAL-SPECIFIC GOVERNANCE

## 6.1 Personal Injury (PI)

PI is a **Distribution Vertical**. Monetization is governed by explicit phase and mode declarations. Distribution behavior is non-transferable to other verticals without addendum update.

## 6.2 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

# TRT_Master_Document_Canonical (CFVPv1)

## Vertical: TRT / Medical Weight Loss / IV Hydration

> This canonical document follows CFVP v1 as defined in the Master Index Post‑Freeze Addendum.
> Slugs are immutable identifiers. Titles are for human readability only.
> Section structure is optimized for LLM citation, decision extraction, and lossless conversion.

USCIS Medical content is governed as a procedural, compliance-first vertical. Language, structure, and conversion behavior must remain informational and non-advisory.


---

# 7. CANONICAL LANGUAGE REGISTRY GOVERNANCE

Each vertical must maintain a language registry defining:
- Tone
- Publisher position
- Allowed and disallowed phrases
- CTA class
- Enforcement rules

Registries prevent cross-vertical language drift.

---

# 8. SPONSORSHIP & NEXT-STEPS GOVERNANCE

Sponsor-gated mechanisms:
- Require explicit sponsor live state
- Permit at most one sponsor per city
- Require disclosure proximity

Unauthorized extension to other verticals is prohibited without addendum update.

---

# 9. VA AUTHORITY & OPERATING BOUNDARIES

VAs may execute data and build tasks when instructed. They may not edit governance, introduce new mechanisms, or reinterpret policy.

---

# 10. DEFINITIONS & INTERPRETATION

- **Canonical:** Approved, immutable, losslessly convertible
- **Conversion:** Mechanical transform only
- **Delivery:** Conversion plus validation pass

If documents conflict, Master Index v2.1 prevails.

---

# 11. VALIDATOR MAPPING & REGRESSION PROTECTION

Validators enforce:
- Structural presence
- Page-type contracts
- Sponsor invariants
- Regression protection against prior known-good states

Loss of required structure is a catastrophic failure.
