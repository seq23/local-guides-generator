# Master Index — Post-Freeze Addendums (Authoritative, Append-Only)

---

## 🔒 PREAMBLE INHERITANCE & GOVERNING AUTHORITY

This addendum **inherits and is governed by the full preamble of Master Index v2.1 (Frozen Canonical)**.

All principles defined in the Master Index v2.1 preamble — including but not limited to:

- content-before-code
- no summarization or compression
- no regeneration of approved text
- deterministic, auditable policy language
- strict separation between governance and execution

apply to this addendum **as if fully restated herein**.

In the event of any perceived ambiguity, the Master Index v2.1 preamble **controls and governs interpretation** of this addendum.

---

## Governance Declaration

---

### Canonical Artifact Completeness Rule (v1.0)

> **Canonical Artifact Completeness Rule (Hard Fail):** Any document marked *Canonical* must be a fully self-contained, literal artifact and contain **no placeholders, stubs, editor notes, shorthand, or references to previously approved content** (e.g., “unchanged,” “same as above,” “TBD”). Violation is a hard fail and blocks locking and conversion.

---

### Machine-Only Marker & Accordion Convertibility Rule (v1.0)

> **Machine-Only Marker & Accordion Convertibility Rule (Hard Fail):** All canonical guide documents must contain valid machine-only markers for every guide and section, and must be directly convertible to JSON and HTML where each numbered section renders as a discrete accordion panel; missing markers, malformed markers, or non-convertible section structures constitute a hard fail.



This canvas is a **governance document**, not a working chat.

It is governed by the same principles as the **Master Index v2.1 preamble**, including:

- Content-before-code
- No summarization or compression
- No regeneration of approved text
- Deterministic, auditable policy language
- Clear separation between governance and execution

This canvas is **policy-only**. No execution steps. No code. No examples.

# 🚨 MASTER INDEX ADDENDUM — PERSONAL INJURY (DISTRIBUTION VERTICAL & PHASE GOVERNANCE)

**Status:** UNLOCKED (Append-Only)
**Effective:** Immediately
**Applies to:** Personal Injury (PI) vertical only

---

## I. STRATEGIC CLASSIFICATION (AUTHORITATIVE)

**Personal Injury (PI) is governed as a Distribution Vertical.**

PI is not evaluated or monetized under authority-based sponsorship models by default.

Reason:

- PI advertisers do not purchase authority or visibility
- PI advertisers purchase **control over intake and case flow**
- Therefore, PI monetization constitutes a **distribution contract**, not a content sponsorship

PI exists in the system as:

- Educational publisher content (Phase-1 compatible)
- With controlled intake and monetization enabled only under explicit phase governance

---

## II. MONETIZATION MODE ENUM (CANONICAL LAW)

Every PI city MUST be classified under exactly one monetization mode.

The following enum is **authoritative**:

- **EDUCATION\_ONLY**
- **DISTRIBUTION\_SPONSORED\_DIRECTORY**
- **FULL\_SITE\_SPONSORSHIP**

Rendering behavior, disclosures, validation, and CTA availability are governed by this enum.

If a city lacks an explicit monetization mode assignment, validation MUST fail.

---

## III. PHASE GOVERNANCE (LOCKED)

### Phase 1 — Foundation (Non-Monetized)

- All PI cities default to **EDUCATION\_ONLY**
- Directory renders neutrally
- No sponsored placement
- No intake CTA
- No indication of availability

Purpose:

- Establish educational authority
- Validate guide performance
- Prepare infrastructure without monetization

---

### Phase 2 — Distribution (Primary PI Monetization Phase)

Phase 2 enables **DISTRIBUTION\_SPONSORED\_DIRECTORY**.

Characteristics:

- Directory remains present and intact
- One firm may purchase **exclusive sponsored placement** within a city directory
- Sponsorship affects **presentation**, not directory existence

**Critical Rule:**

> Sponsored directory behavior is permitted **only** during Phase 2 or later.

Phase 2 is the **default monetization phase for PI**.

---

### Phase 3 — Full-Site Sponsorship (Optional / Non-Primary)

Phase 3 enables **FULL\_SITE\_SPONSORSHIP**.

Characteristics:

- Entire PI site or vertical is sponsored by a single firm
- Global disclosures required
- Directory may remain but sponsorship scope is site-wide

This phase:

- May be offered (e.g., \$75K)
- Is not required for PI success
- Does not replace Phase-2 distribution as the core model

---

## IV. SPONSORED DIRECTORY BEHAVIOR (PHASE-2 LOCKED)

When a city is classified as **DISTRIBUTION\_SPONSORED\_DIRECTORY**:

- The directory **MUST remain rendered**
- The directory **MUST NOT be removed, hidden, or replaced**

### Sponsored Placement Rules

- One sponsored firm block appears **at the top of the directory**
- Sponsored block may include:
  - Firm name
  - Location relevance
  - CTA (e.g., "Request a confidential consultation")

### Directory Integrity Rules

- Non-sponsored directory entries remain visible below
- No rankings or ordering claims may be implied
- No comparative language is permitted

Sponsored placement modifies **emphasis**, not structure.

---

## V. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

When any sponsored placement exists, an inline disclosure MUST appear immediately above the sponsored block.

**Canonical Disclosure (Concise, Required):**

> **Disclosure:** Paid placement. We partner with one licensed personal injury firm per market. No outcomes are guaranteed.

Rules:

- This disclosure is **monetization-specific** and does not replace or duplicate the global disclaimer or footer
- The disclosure MUST be proximate to the sponsored block
- The disclosure MUST appear only when a sponsored placement exists
- Omission, alteration, or relocation of the disclosure is a validation failure.

---

## VI. VALIDATION RULES (POLICY-LEVEL)

Validation MUST fail if any of the following are true:

- A PI city lacks a monetization mode assignment

- A city marked **EDUCATION\_ONLY** renders:

  - Sponsored blocks
  - CTAs
  - Intake signaling

- A city marked **DISTRIBUTION\_SPONSORED\_DIRECTORY**:

  - Omits the directory
  - Omits required disclosure
  - Renders more than one sponsored firm

- A city marked **FULL\_SITE\_SPONSORSHIP**:

  - Omits global sponsorship disclosure

Monetization mode violations are **hard failures**, not warnings.

---

## VII. GOVERNANCE GUARANTEE

This addendum ensures:

- Clean transition between unpaid and paid states
- Compliance-first monetization
- Clear value proposition for sponsoring firms
- Zero ambiguity for operators, VAs, or validators

PI monetization is governed as a **controlled distribution system**, not an advertising free-for-all.

# APPENDIX A — VA OPERATING SOP (AUTHORITATIVE)

**Status:** UNLOCKED (Append-Only)
**Applies to:** All VAs, contractors, operators acting on this system
**Governs:** Human execution layer only

## I. PURPOSE

This appendix defines **what human operators (VAs) are permitted to do**, **what they must do**, and **when they must stop**.

It exists to ensure:

- deterministic execution
- zero silent drift
- clean escalation boundaries
- auditability of all human work

This SOP is **binding**.

## II. AUTHORITY & BOUNDARIES

### VA Authority Includes

A VA **may**:

- Create draft content **only when explicitly instructed**
- Move approved text between formats **without modification**
- Run validation or checklists
- Flag failures, gaps, or ambiguities
- Prepare artifacts for review

### VA Authority Explicitly Excludes

A VA **may not**:

- Invent or modify policy
- Interpret intent beyond written instruction
- Rewrite “approved” or “canonical” text
- Skip required phases
- “Fix” validation failures silently
- Proceed when a hard failure is detected

## III. REQUIRED ORDER OF OPERATIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All VA work must follow this order:

1. **Confirm Canonical Source**

   - Identify the governing Master Index version + addendum
   - If unclear → STOP

2. **Confirm Phase**

   - Authoring / QA / Conversion / Validation / Release
   - If phase is ambiguous → STOP

3. **Execute Assigned Task Only**

   - No adjacent cleanup
   - No anticipatory changes

4. **Run Required Checklist**

   - QA checklist
   - Validation checklist
   - Phase-specific checklist

5. **Escalate or Deliver**

   - Deliver only after PASS
   - Escalate immediately on FAIL

Deviation is prohibited.

## IV. HARD STOP CONDITIONS (IMMEDIATE ESCALATION)

A VA must **stop work and escalate** if any of the following occur:

- Missing canonical source
- Conflicting instructions
- Validation failure
- Missing required artifact
- Ambiguous approval state
- Any request that violates Master Index governance

“No response” is preferable to an incorrect response.

## V. DELIVERABLE STANDARDS

Any VA-delivered artifact must be:

- Complete
- Lossless relative to source
- Clearly labeled (draft / review / final)
- Traceable to a governing document

Partial or speculative delivery is invalid.

## VI. GOVERNANCE GUARANTEE

This SOP ensures:

- VAs cannot accidentally change policy
- Errors surface early
- Accountability is explicit
- Scale does not introduce chaos

---

# APPENDIX B — QA SIGN-OFF CHECKLIST (CANONICAL)

**Status:** UNLOCKED (Append-Only)
**Applies to:** All guides, all verticals

## I. PURPOSE

This checklist converts the **Canonical Guide QA Rubric** into a **binary sign-off artifact**.

A guide **cannot be locked** unless all items pass.

## II. QA SIGN-OFF (PASS / FAIL)

### Layer 0 — Structural Integrity

-

### Layer 1 — Primary Question Alignment

-

### Layer 2 — Decision Completeness

-

### Layer 3 — Situational Specificity

-

### Layer 4 — LLM Extractability

-

### Layer 5 — Human Helpfulness

-

### Layer 6 — Authority & Depth

-

## III. SIGN-OFF RULE

- Any FAIL → Guide is **not canonical**
- Partial passes are invalid
- Word count does not override logic failure

---

# APPENDIX C — VERTICAL LAUNCH SOP (AUTHORITATIVE)

**Status:** UNLOCKED (Append-Only)
**Applies to:** All current and future verticals

## I. PURPOSE

This SOP defines the **only permitted sequence** for launching or expanding a vertical.

Its goal is to make vertical launches **predictable, repeatable, and boring**.

## II. REQUIRED PHASES (ORDERED)

### Phase 1 — Canonical Authoring

Required:

- Single canonical authoring surface (Canvas MD)
- Immutable guide slugs
- Primary questions defined per guide

Prohibited:

- Conversion
- JSON generation
- Repo changes

### Phase 2 — QA & Lock

Required:

- Full QA checklist pass (Appendix B)
- Explicit “LOCKED” declaration
- No unresolved failures

Prohibited:

- Partial locking
- Conditional approval

### Phase 3 — Conversion Preparation

Required:

- Canonical source exported
- Section counts confirmed
- Word counts confirmed

Prohibited:

- Regeneration
- Interpretation
- Rewriting

### Phase 4 — Mechanical Conversion

Required:

- Lossless format transformation
- No placeholders
- No stubs

Conversion ≠ Delivery.

### Phase 5 — Validation

Required:

- Structural validation
- Page contract validation
- Regression checks

Any failure blocks release.

### Phase 6 — Release

Only permitted after:

- All validation passes
- All artifacts verified
- Governance intact

## III. HARD FAILURE CONDITIONS

A vertical launch must halt if:

- Any phase is skipped
- Canonical source is ambiguous
- Validation fails
- Governance conflicts exist

## IV. GOVERNANCE GUARANTEE

This SOP ensures:

- No vertical launches prematurely
- No content drift
- No validator surprises
- No “how did this get live?” moments

---

### END OF APPENDICES A–C

---

# APPENDIX D — DEFINITIONS & CANONICAL TERMS (AUTHORITATIVE)

**Status:** UNLOCKED (Append-Only)
**Applies to:** All governance, validation, and execution contexts

## I. PURPOSE

This appendix defines canonical terms used throughout the Master Index v2.1 and all post-freeze addendums.

Its purpose is to eliminate interpretive drift, especially as work is delegated across humans, tools, and time.

---

## II. CANONICAL DEFINITIONS

**Canonical**\
Text, structure, or artifacts that are approved, locked, and serve as the sole source of truth. Canonical material may not be modified except through an explicit governance change.

**Lock / Locked**\
A declared state indicating that content has passed all required QA and validation gates. Locked content may be referenced, converted, or validated, but not rewritten.

**Append-Only**\
A governance rule permitting additions but prohibiting silent edits, rewrites, or deletions of previously approved material.

**Phase**\
A governance-controlled stage defining what actions are permitted (e.g., authoring, monetization, conversion). Phases are sequential and non-overlapping.

**Distribution Vertical**\
A vertical where monetization is based on controlled routing or intake behavior rather than authority, visibility, or impressions (e.g., Personal Injury).

**Sponsored Directory**\
A directory that remains structurally intact while allowing one paid placement to modify emphasis or prominence, subject to disclosure and validation rules.

**Validator**\
An automated or manual system that checks structural, semantic, and governance compliance. Validators enforce failure conditions but do not determine usefulness or quality.

**QA (Quality Assurance)**\
A decision-layer evaluation determining whether content is complete, helpful, specific, and safe to lock. QA is required in addition to validation.

**Conversion**\
A mechanical transformation of canonical content into another format. Conversion alone does not imply correctness or deliverability.

**Delivery**\
Conversion plus a full sanity, syntax, and validation pass. Delivery may only occur after all checks pass.

---

## III. INTERPRETATION RULE

If a term is used ambiguously or inconsistently in execution, the definition in this appendix prevails.

---

# APPENDIX E — VALIDATOR & QA MAPPING (REFERENCE-ONLY, AUTHORITATIVE)

**Status:** UNLOCKED (Append-Only)
**Applies to:** Validator design, QA execution, and regression prevention

---

## I. PURPOSE

This appendix maps **QA intent** to **validator enforcement** so that automated checks and human review operate on the same mental model.

It is reference-only and does not redefine existing validator logic.

---

## II. QA LAYER → VALIDATOR RESPONSIBILITY MAP

| QA Layer                          | What It Ensures                     | Validator Role                              | Failure Type |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Layer 0 — Structural Integrity    | Required sections and markers exist | Enforce presence, order, markers            | Hard Fail    |
| Layer 1 — Primary Question        | Guide answers its core question     | Detect missing or unanswered title question | Hard Fail    |
| Layer 2 — Decision Completeness   | Decision logic is complete          | Flag missing required decision blocks       | Hard Fail    |
| Layer 3 — Situational Specificity | Scenario-resolved guidance          | Detect shell or generic patterns            | Hard Fail    |
| Layer 4 — LLM Extractability      | Self-contained, quotable logic      | Flag missing answer blocks                  | Hard Fail    |
| Layer 5 — Human Helpfulness       | Clarity and confidence              | Human QA only                               | Lock Blocker |
| Layer 6 — Authority & Depth       | Risk-appropriate depth              | Human QA only                               | Lock Blocker |

---

## III. REGRESSION PROTECTION

Validators must additionally support:

- Page type contract enforcement
- Required zone detection (FAQ, directory, guides block)
- Ad slot resolution checks
- Golden-city regression checks

Loss of any previously required structure is a **catastrophic failure**.

---

## IV. GOVERNANCE CLARIFICATION

Validators:

- Enforce structure and safety
- Prevent silent regressions

Validators do not:

- Judge usefulness
- Approve locking
- Replace human QA

---
